Rough Outline of Character Background or Tezzaran. 

Born to Vedalken parents on Ravnica. Mother is  a member of the Simic Combine. Father was Guildless, always enjoyed the Rakdos shows, and never minded a good explosion. 

Born called Zatar. One of a pair of unidentical twins. Twin Sister was called Zasha.  Likes explosions so didn't mind joining the Izzet League. Twin sister joined Azorius chose Tazoria. 3 other Siblings. Two in the Simic Combine after their mothers footsteps. Father runs a shop selling a variety of cross-guild artefacts: mizzium metal stuff, Boros weapons, (all of which Tazoria helped him secure the correct licenses for)

Member of the Izzet League. Works as an Izzet Engineer in the Laboratory of Apothecary. Rivalry with the Laboratory of Alchemy as technically we share the same titles.

Setting:  Planeshifted to Rau Karda. Portal opened up by accident after an experiment gone wrong (I was aged 80). Appears to be the fault of the Izzet league and many appear at once. One way portals.

It was investigated and was unstable. We shipped stuff over to build an offshoot of Izzet. I join it to work in a new lab based here: The Laboratory of Apothecary. The portal closed a couple of years after it opened. 

City is a steampunk floating city and it an oligarchy, with a ruling class from the Alchemy Lab. Other Labs include: Gravitational Inversion; Storms and Electricity; Apothecary

When I was 280 a portal and out in the wilds, a portal like the one I saw in Ravnica opens up in from of me and a Grung falls out. I tried to get them to come with me as proof but they refuse. Failing to get the Grung to leave the forest, and feeling some sort of duty. I arrange to meet it often in the wilds and soften it to the charms of city life. I learn Grung.
