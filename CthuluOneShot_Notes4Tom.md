# Call of Cthulu - Session 1/3 - 17/04/25

Joining Ron Livewell this evening 
Pierre Clouseau (he's French) - ex-cop PI
Eleanor Harding - Professional Archeologist 
Madame Marinka - Fortune Teller (can actually predict the future sometimes)
Chester - Lumberjack, Carpenter

Eleanor found a new dinosaur on the dig that we did after the last encounter. The Doyouthinkhesaurus. She assembled the bones into the order she thought was right and brought it back to the Worthlap Museum where it is a instant success. The museum is now flush with cash. Prof McTavish is overjoyed with this. He has invited you and the team to come visit, he has a special job for us by way of reward.  

## Day 1 (9am - Morning of Spring 1921)  
The party goes to the museum. Professor McTavish says that the current Archeology and Paleantology wings of the Museum are very sucessful, but we shoudl do new things, and capture the interest of the time. Since we now have an increased budget to do new things, now is the perfect time to act. He says we can expand our scope into Anthropology, and since people nowadays have a strange attraction to the occult. He wants to start a new wing of the museum of the Anthrolopolgy and the Occult. The Prof wants us to acquire some new items for this wing of the exhibit, however the early colonials took all the best shit back to Europe. He has a lead we can follow.
~~~
McTavish: Here's a leaflet! Go to Vienna and get some exhibits for this museum 
~~~
He'll give us $4000 for expenses which can include hotels, we'll need tickets for a ship and passports. We'll also need to get suits because we're hobnobbing with the rich. We will need to exhange some for local currency. Interested in lots 4, 12 and 15 - $3000 for this, they come from the Americas. The auction will be conducted in pounds. He'll give a commission for the reserve price for items we bring back. There's a sword here as well so we will need to investigate if we can purchase this and bring it back with the necessary papers.

First stop getting passports. We then go to the records office to get our passports. We meet Ian (again)! He's now working there. We fill in forms and get our photos taken and pay $20 as fees for this. Ian has a cousin working at the Miscatonic Library (the Library of the university - the big Gothic building with all the Gargoyles). 

Ian also manages the bureau de change, but we're not sure how much money of each currency we need yet. 
~~~
Ron: You're working a lot of jobs, you must have a loving family, you will need the comfort of a safety net should things go wrong, have you considered life insurance: *hands Ian a card*
Ian: Very good, I'll file this away very carefully in my Rolerdex
~~~
Ian also gives us the name of a travel agent, and name of a suit shop: Fancy Suits Ltd and we head there we close at 5am 

Heading to the Travel agents. There is a ship that can get us there in time but it's leaving 6 days from now, and the overall journey could be around 10 days. The RMS Olympic (the sister ship to you-know-who) is due to set sail from New York (which is a couple hours drive from here), via Southhampton to Hamburg. 

Standard fare is $200 a person each way which includes food. Taking a car is an extra $200. With the 6 of us that $2600. First Class both ways would have been $6400, but Ron pulls out his sellers batter, wheeler-dealers and bamboozles the salesman down to a price of $3500 (There isn't really much demand for First Class tickets). After discussing the budget we decide to go First class there (to rub shoulders with the rich guys on the way to the auction) and Standard back which will set us back $3000. The return trip from Hamburg is two weeks after the trip there. 

When it comes to Vienna. There are Two hotels: Hotel Kummer (very fancy), Hotel Bristol (moderate) - They'll take pounds. For the Lodging Houses around the City which are the cheapest we'll need Kroners. £5 high class, £2-3 medium and low (50p in Kroner) pppn. We should plan for a few nights stay and breakfast will be included. 

This takes us to Lunch (Vinnie's opened a branch here in Arkham!). We go clothes shopping and settle on some flash items at a rate of $50pp and $10 for the Monkey.

## Day 2 (Spring 1921)  
After a day spend prepping the technicals of the journey, we have 5 days of free time to prepare for Vienna and the Auction. Ron will want to brush up on some skills so he doesn't make a fool of himself in high society, and see if he can get the right paperwork for the car, since we're planning to use it to drive from Hamburg to Vienna and back. Marinka and Eleanor will research the occult items. Pierre will take the time to learn some beginner German. Chester will take the time fashion a Swordcane to go with his suit, and purchases a blade to go inside this cane.

Madane Morinka wants to get some insights into what items to investigate so sets up a ritual and dangles her stone necklace to see if it's attracted to any of the items. She is drawn to 
- Lots 1: (strongly) The Blood Ankh,
- 4: (strongly) The Hand of Glory,
- 6: The Magus,
- 7: (strongly) The Sword,
- 9: (strongly) Riveted Brass Head,
- 12: Prodigies in the New-England Canaan,
- 16: Gold Ring with the Seal of Solomon. 

Seeing as it was on the list of items pointed out by the professor (and Madame Morinka was drawn to it) Eleanor investigates The Hand of The Hand of Glory.

Hands of Glory
-----
They are made specifically from the hands of hanged murderers (the hand that did the deed is preferred). They are reputed to be have certain propoerties if the right rituals were performed. Some properties include but are not limited to: 
  - shedding light only the user can see,
  - the ability to send someone to sleep,
  - the ability to summon the dead (reportedly),
  - pointing way to treasure (also not from as reliable sources).
This one is tracked to an American (United-Statian) murderer in the 1890's. 
-----

Ron wants more information about the high-society Europeans as he doesn't want to embarrass himself in front of them. He makes his way to the university and meets with a professor at the university who specialises in European Culture. 

##### European Nobility
On the nobility themselves - He is told that nobled in Europe usually speak fluent English. They don't work for a living and they have financial interest covering their daily expenditures. They are used to being taken care of by teams of many servants. For sport they like gambling shooting an dancing, and they like driving and flying as hobbies. The occult is a new fascination that has entered a sort of renaissance over the last centry and is a common thing for nobles to be interested in. He should not try to immitate an accent, they have interactions with Americans before and they will be even able to place the city/state you are from! The locals and less nobled will not know much is any English at all, they will speak German - but some may speak French.  In the likes of ettiquette. Ron was taught when to bow, when to kiss a hand of a lady, and what What the different kind of forks are, this doesn't really take. To Ron it comes clear that it's some sort of rutual pomp and circumstance that has no real meaning. If you are not born to all of this it is very hard to fake it. 

##### Austria and the Auction House
They lost the war, and it was very bad for the economy. There is hyperinflation in the country, and nobody uses kroner. The nobles use pound sterling, and the auction house will use that as well. A lot of the old houses have lost a lot of money as a result of this depression, and since they don't have active income to make ends meet or liquidity to try and prop up their enterprises - a lot of them are selling off things to make ends meet. The Auctionhouse is one such place where they sell items collected, and it has a strong reputation for discression. The sellers of items are kept a secret. The auctioners are incorruptable, they pride themselves inreputation for fairness, and they serve their clients well. Carrying a deadly weapon in Austria is only permissible with a permit, and these are only open to citizens. The open carrying of weapons is forbidden (with an exception made for officers swords), and bringing weapons into the country is expressely forbidden as Visitors are forbidden from carrying weapons. In Germany and Austria this is very strongly enforced. Jailtime will be dished out if any infraction on this rule is found. If you get a weapon in a reputable auctionhouse, however, they will give you the necessary papers to get it back to the US.

## Day 3 (Spring 1921) 
Madame Marika the starts an investigation into The Blood Ankh (it will take her three days she's not very good at finding the things she needs here). 

Blood Ankh
-----
It is made of copper and silver but also other things in it that are unknown to science. It is very old. There are markings on the front that are specifically not egyptian heiroglyphs, the are called heriatic symbols - the language of Mu. Philosophus Magnus reportedly used it to summon daemons, and he was burned at the stake in 1371. Then used by in 1581 by a Spanish woman, Lady Maria Spendoza, who murdered children and bathed the ankh in their blood. She committed suicide in prison (found with her throat torn out in her cell). 

-----

Eleanor investigates the sword, the Brass head and the Prodogies. For the sword. On the pommel she find Azoth. Paracelsus was a German philosopher and alchemist from the 1350 in Germany. He summoned a daemon and trapped it in the hilt of the sword to do his bidding. Azoth was a vital alchemical symbols that make life possible and hused to help trapped the daemon in the sword. 

For the head, it was constructed by a Black Magician in imitaion of Roger Bacon. The German sourcedescribes the head as having the ability to answer questions of deep philosophy and physics and deep via a ceremony. The ceremony is burning blood and pouring it over the head of it to awaken what intelligence is in the head which you can then question. 

For the brochure, much of what's in it is fanciful, but there are a lot of matches of which you know to be true. Other scholars have corroberated some of the content in this pamphlet. If you read this book it would teach you about real interactions between humans and otherworldy beings. 

M Marika then investigates the Ring. She has a book that is useful for this. This is a depiction of the seal of Solomon. King Solomon used it to command and imprison daemons. Arabic magicians have used it to imprison daemons

Eleanor investigates book from lot 6: Magus. It helped start the occult resurgence in the last century, written by Francis Barret, some was a savant, and some was a charlatan. Mainstay of modern occultism. This is a first edition signed from 1801. The Miscatonic University has a later copy of this book. There are rumours that material was removed from later editions. They are able to take out this book, they can look at it but not take it out. 



Ron wants to get some papers for his car
~~~
Kirk: Sell some insurance!

He purchased the Milk float that killed my father.
~~~
After this converstion Ron is a little less sane. 

Calls and meet Kirk Propser  Deed of Ownership is what is needed. They are in a milk float and he has them. 
Sell some life insurance. 

There are papers in the glove box (luckily) but they are made out to one August Wayland has Rolls Royce branding on in the papers. He hands them to Eleanor who fumbles it, but manages to change the name to Ron Livewell, Ron is very happy with this. He services the car. 

We go back to Ian to change currency, they don't deal in Kroner, so we turn everything into pounds.

*Will not bring his gun with him* Scared about being put in prison. Will have a gentlemans cane with him. 

## 5 days later (9am - Morning of Spring 1921)  
We pick up Professor McTavish and drive to the New York Docks. A crane lifts a car onto the ship. We're in first class. We are shown to very nice places with space for a valet. We venture out to sea. In the dining room that evening

We see some of the nobility. And Marie Curie is in there. Pierre sees Arthur Conan Doyle, Ron recognises after a double take Charlie Chaplain, and we all recognise Prince Edward - Prince of Wales.

Chester chats to CHarlie and comes up with a set for an car that falls apart. 

~~~
Ron 
~~~
Ron manages to sell Charlie Chaplain insurance while on the crossing is Charlie Chaplain is insured against all damages from filming. Premiums are high, he's paying good money. Movie stars at the time are enrolled MGM quite.   

Eleanor is conversing with Marie Curie who is reading a paper with her in it. They talk about the bones and the discovery, they Radio carbon date all the bones. all the bones come from 6 differnet time periods - yikes.

Madame Marinka approaches Arthur Conan Doyle and they talk she agrees to perform a ritual for him at midnight. 
Pierre tells of the ACD about a cursed mansion and tells him of the story and they write that book together essentailly. When midnight falls, he goes to the upper deck and MM performs a ritual to contact the dead lost at the sea, she also drugs the tea that hes using to keep him warm. 

Later in the voyage while checking the are, A steamy handprint on the window looking like it was coming from the inside. Under the back seat I find a garter, *tut tut*. Will keep this to investigate further.  

At around 10 days the ship reaches Southhampton and these poeple stay off and we arrive in Hamburg. The car is craned out of the hold. 4 days until the start of the journey. Nobody really important got on the ship at Southhampton.
