Joining Ron Livewell this evening 
Pierre Clouseau (he's French) - ex-cop PI
Eleanor Harding - Professional Archeologist 
Madame Marinka - Fortune Teller (can actually predict the future sometimes)
Chester - Lumberjack, Carpenter

Eleanor found a new dinosaur on the dig that we did after the last encounter. The Doyouthinkhesaurus. She assembled the bones into the order she thought was right and brought it back to the Worthlap Museum where it is a instant success. The museum is now flush with cash. Prof McTavish is overjoyed with this. He has invited you and the team to come visit, he has a special job for us by way of reward.  

## Day 1 (9am - Morning of Spring 1921)  
The party goes to the museum. Professor McTavish says that the current Archeology and Paleantology wings of the Museum are very sucessful, but we shoudl do new things, and capture the interest of the time. Since we now have an increased budget to do new things, now is the perfect time to act. He says we can expand our scope into Anthropology, and since people nowadays have a strange attraction to the occult. He wants to start a new wing of the museum of the Anthrolopolgy and the Occult. The Prof wants us to acquire some new items for this wing of the exhibit, however the early colonials took all the best shit back to Europe. He has a lead we can follow.

McTavish: Here's a leaflet! Go to Vienna and get some exhibits for this museum 
~~~
He'll give us $4000 for expenses which can include hotels, we'll need a ship, passports. We'll need to get suits because we're hobnobbing with the rich. But we need to exhange some for local currency. Interested in lots 4, 12 and 15 - $3000 for this, they come from the Americas. The auction will be conducted in pounds. He'll give a commission for the reserve price for items we bring back. There's a sword here as well so we will need to investigate if we can bring these papers back.

First stop getting passports. We go to the records office to get passports. We meet Ian! He's now working there. We fill in forms and get our photos taken. We pay $20 as fees for this. Ian has a cousin Miscatonic Library (the Library of the university - the big Gothic building with all the Gargoyles). 

Ian also manages the bureau de change, but we're not sure how much money of each currency we need. 
~~~
Ron: You're working a lot of jobs, you must have a lovign family, you will need the comfortof a safety net should things go wrong, have you considered life insurance: *hands Ian a card*
Ian: Very good, I'll file this away very carefully in my Rolerdex
~~~
Ian also gives us the name of a travel agent, and name of a suit shop: Fancy Suits Ltd and we head there we close at 5am 

Heading to the Travel agents. There is a ship that can get us there in time but it's leaving 5 days from now, and the overall journey could be arounf 10 days. The RMS Olympic from New York, via Southhampton to Hamburg.  Which is a few hours from here. $200 a person each way which includes food. Taking a car is an extra $200. 

First Class both ways would have been $6400, but Ron wheeler-dealers and bamboozles the salesman down to $3500. Standard Class would be $2500 for the same. After discussing the budget we decide to go First class there (to rub shoulders with the rich guys on the way to the auction) and Standard back $3000. The return trip from Hamburg is two weeks after the trip there. 

When it comes to Vienna. Two hotels: Hotel Kummer (very fancy), Hotel Bristol - They'll take pounds. Lodging Houses around the City we'll need Kroners. £5 high class, £2-3 medium and low (50p in Kroner) pppn. We should plan for a few nights stay and breakfast will be included. 

This takes us to Lunch (Vinnie's opened a branch here in Arkham!). We go clothes shopping and settle on some flash items at a rate of $50pp and $10 for the Monkey.

## Day 2 (9am - Morning of Spring 1921)  
We have 5 days of free time. Ron will want to brush up on some skills so he doesn't make a fool of himself in high society. The rest of the party. Marinka and Eleanor will look at occult. Pierre will learn German. Chester will make a Swordcane. Madane Morinka wants to get some insights into what items to investigate so sets up a ritual and dangles her stone necklace to see if it's attracted to any of the items. She is drawn to Lots 1 (strong) The Blood Ankh, 4 (strong) The Hand of Glory, 6 (The Magus), 7 (strong) The Sword, 9 (strong) Riveted Brass Head, 12 Prodigies in the New-England Canaan, 16 Gold Ring with Seal of Solomon. 

Eleanor investigates The Hand of The Hand of Glory is reputed to be have certain propoerties if the right rituals were performed. (shed light only the user can see, send someone to sleep, also to summon dead, pointing way to treasure). This one is tracked to an American murderer in the 1890's. 

M Marika then investigates The Blood Ankh. It is made of copper and silver but also other things in it that are unknown to science. It is very old. There are markings on the front that are specifically not egyptian heiroglyphs, the are called heriatic symbols - the language of Mu. Philosophus Magnus reportedly used it to summon daemons, and he was burned at the stake in 1371. Then used by in 1581 by a Spanish woman, Lady Maria Spendoza, who murdered children and bathed the ankh in their blood. She committed suicide in prison (found with her throat torn out in her cell). 

Eleanor investigates the sword, the Brass head and the Prodogies. For the sword. On the pommel she find Azoth. Paracelsus was a German philosopler and alchemist from the 1350 in Germany. He summoned a daemon and trapped it in the hilt of the sword to do his bidding. Azoth was a vital alchemical symbols that make life possible and hused to help trapped the daemon in the sword. 

For the head, it was constructed by a Black Magician in imitaion of Roger Bacon. The German sourcedescribes the head as having the ability to answer questions of deep philosophy and physics and deep via a ceremony. The ceremony is burning blood and pouring it over the head of it to awaken what intelligence is in the head which you can then question. 

For the brochure, much of what's in it is fanciful, but there are a lot of matches of which you know to be true. Other scholars have corroberated some of the content in this pamphlet. If you read this book it would teach you about real interactions between humans and otherworldy beings. 

M Marika then investigates the Ring. She has a book that is useful for this. This is a depiction of the seal of Solomon. King Solomon used it to command and imprison daemons. Arabic magicians have used it to imprison daemons

Eleanor investigates book from lot 6: Magus. It helped start the occult resurgence in the last century, written by Francis Barret, some was a savant, and some was a charlatan. Mainstay of modern occultism. This is a first edition signed from 1801. The Miscatonic University has a later copy of this book. There are rumours that material was removed from later editions. They are able to take out this book, they can look at it but not take it out. 

Rons wants more information about the high-societies europeans as he doesn't want to embarrass themselves. usually speak fluent English. They do ont work for a living, they have financial interest, They are used to being taken care of my servent, they like gambling shooting an dracing, and they like dribing and flying as hobbies. The occult over the last centry is a common thing for nobles to be interested in. Specifically to Austria: They lost the war, very bad for the economy. There is hyperinflation. Nobody uses kroner, they all use pound sterling. A lot of the old houses have lost a lot of money as a result of this depression. they don't have an income. to make ends meet a lot of them are selling off things to make ends meet. The Auctionhouse is one where they, reputations for discression. Sellers of items are kept a secret. They are incorruptable, they pride themselves inreputation for fairness, and they serve their clients well. Carrying a deadly weapon in Austria is only permissible with a permit, and these are only open to citizens. Open carry is forbitten and jail will be there. If you get a weapon in a reputable auctionhouse, they will give you the papers to get it back. Visitors are forbidden for carrying weapons. In Germany and Austria this is very strongly enforced. An exception is made for officers swords. Nobles say don't hide your acent htey are very used to dealing with Americans. The locals and less nobles will not know any german at all, but some may speak French. 

For ettiquette. When to bow, kiss a hand of a lady. What the forks are. If you are not born to all of this it is very hard to fake this.

Kirk: Sell some insurance!

He purchased the Milk float that killed my father.
~~~
After this converstion Ron is a little less sane. 

Calls and meet Kirk Propser  Deed of Ownership is what is needed. They are in a milk float and he has them. 
Sell some life insurance. 

There are papers in the glove box (luckily) but they are made out to one August Wayland has Rolls Royce branding on in the papers. He hands them to Eleanor who fumbles it, but manages to change the name to Ron Livewell, Ron is very happy with this. He services the car. 

We go back to Ian to change currency, they don't deal in Kroner, so we turn everything into pounds.

*Will not bring his gun with him* Scared about being put in prison. Will have a gentlemans cane with him. 

## 5 days later (9am - Morning of Spring 1921)  
We pick up Professor McTavish and drive to the New York Docks. A crane lifts a car onto the ship. We're in first class. We are shown to very nice places with space for a valet. We venture out to sea. In the dining room that evening

We see some of the nobility. And Marie Curie is in there. Pierre sees Arthur Conan Doyle, Ron recognises after a double take Charlie Chaplain, and we all recognise Prince Edward - Prince of Wales.

Chester chats to CHarlie and comes up with a set for an car that falls apart.

Ron

Ron manages to sell Charlie Chaplain insurance while on the crossing is Charlie Chaplain is insured against all damages from filming. Premiums are high, he's paying good money. Movie stars at the time are enrolled MGM quite.   

Eleanor is conversing with Marie Curie who is reading a paper with her in it. They talk about the bones and the discovery, they Radio carbon date all the bones. all the bones come from 6 differnet time periods - yikes.

Madame Marinka approaches Arthur Conan Doyle and they talk she agrees to perform a ritual for him at midnight. 
Pierre tells of the ACD about a cursed mansion and tells him of the story and they write that book together essentailly. When midnight falls, he goes to the upper deck and MM performs a ritual to contact the dead lost at the sea, she also drugs the tea that hes using to keep him warm. 

Later in the voyage while checking the are, A steamy handprint on the window looking like it was coming from the inside. Under the back seat I find a garter, *tut tut*. Will keep this to investigate further.  

At around 10 days the ship reaches Southhampton and these poeple stay off and we arrive in Hamburg. The car is craned out of the hold. 4 days until the start of the journey. Nobody really important got on the ship at Southhampton.
