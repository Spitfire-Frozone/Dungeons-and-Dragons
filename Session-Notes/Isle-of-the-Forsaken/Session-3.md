# Isle of the Forsaken - Session 3 - 29/09/21
 

## Day 6 (April 19th) Part 2 - Weather: Sunny with Moderate Wind.

The party sets foot within the gates. Directly head of us is an inn called the Rivers Bounty, it's walls hold an insignia of a fish leaping between two mugs of ale. They see a young Human woman (Ginger hair, athletic build 5'11ft tall, grey eyes and brown skin) running towards the inn, hopping the fence and dashes in the front door. From behind the inn another person (olive skinned and with black hair) hopping the fence to a building to the west. 

The party are slightly bewildered at these events, and the woman seems slightly panicked. After a minute, a scream is heard from the tavern and the ginger woman bursts out. She is accompanied by a blonde-haired skinny woman. They both hops the fence and runs in a southernly direction. Tezzaran calls out to them. 

~~~
Tezzaran: Do you need help?
~~~

The blonde one continues on ignoring this call, but the ginger woman stops, and looking confused she turns around slowly makes her way towards the party. From the house to the west the person that just run in is joined by a pink-skinned blue-haired "Karen" Aasimar, and they run in the direction of the blonde woman.  
~~~
Ginger Woman: You know what, you might actually be able to help?
Tezzaran: We're here so we might as well. 
Orianna: Stop! We can help you, but can you give us more information first
Ginger Woman: Look, there's injured people in the church, can you help us?!
~~~

The party follows the running ginger woman to the church to the south of the village. 
~~~
Nightingale: *mimmicks police siren*
~~~

At the church the blonde woman is in a heated discussion with a Tiefling man (black skin, white eyes and longer-than-shoulder length black hair) whose lower part of left arm is missing (looks like it's torn off) and bleeding out on the floor. 
~~~
G'rung: Need help with kill?
~~~

At this remark, everyone in the church turns to look at the frog. 

~~~
Tezzaran: What my friend means is how can we be of service?
Aasimar woman: My daughters partner is still out there. Something has come over the forest recently and it caught the hunters unawares. We need someone to go out and see what happened?
Tezzaran: *breaths out* What is your name, who are we looking for and how many of you returned.

Baka: Take me to the wounded

Jazmal: My name is Jazmal. Two people are missing Robert (Cersei's father) and Mormo (Seers parner) are missing. Two are injured. The two runners returned unharmed. 
Tezzaran: What's the quickest way to get to where they came from. 
~~~

Baka goes over to the wounded and helps out, but the Loxodons present are doing a better job. 

Three more people enter the fray. The leader (black hair red eyes, purle skin. Short horns that curl up a little.) kicks open the church door. They are wearing studded leather armour. The second is a young pink tiefling that stares at the leader in awe, and the third is a white skin sliver-eyed tiefling. The leader start shouting at people for an update.   

They see us and head over. 

~~~
Tiefling Leader: Who are you?
Tezzaran: We are passing strangers. Looking to help out in any way we can 
Tiefling Leader: Good, more backup
Baka: Now is not the time for many words
G'rung: We need help. Let go now.
Tezzaran: I know. I know.
~~~

Jazmal rattles off a list of local landmarks to Entropy who heads off in that direction. The party follow them in persuit.
~~~
Tezzran: *jogging after the leader* Excuse me, we'll join you, but what are your names
Tiefling Leader: Entropy
Astar: I'm Astar and he (pointing at the star-strucken tiefling) is Chairon. 
~~~

On the way to the forest. Entropy explains that they are training to be an adventurer like us. The town has an elder system, made up of the most senior of each of the professions. The forest we are going starts off being semi-lush but quickly turns into one where the trees have gnarled leaves and what should be underbush is more spiked vines and dead plants. It's conspiciously absent of any bird or creature noises. This seemed to happen about a month ago after a thunderstorm and this darkness is spreading towards the town. They do not know what the creature looks like. 

The party reach the bad parts of the forest. 
~~~
Tezzaran: How will find this creature.
G'rung: Me know hunt. There will be scream.
Tezzaran: *Looking around* I think I agree with you G'rung. I don't see a single creature track. I think the creature will find us first rather than us finding it.
G'rung: Me told you. 
~~~

Nightingale jumps back as she spots a mummifies hand underneath her foot. The party looks at it and Tezzaran pokes it with a stick. It just seems to be a severed mummified hand. 

~~~
Baka: I don't think this hand belongs to any of the people we are looking for. I think we should move on.
Tezzaran: I agree. *kicks the hand into the bushes.* Lets not let that spook someone else.
Bastion: I think we should journey to the site where the creature was last spotted.
Entropy: I agree
~~~

Baka and G'rung spot a mangle leg in a tree, and then see someone in the tree attached to that leg. They are staring at the ground and cowering in fear of the nearby forest, but the party see nothing. 

~~~
Baka: *shouting to person in tree* Should we not be on the ground. 
Tree dweller: It's here, it's just very still. If I take my eyes off it, I will lose it.
~~~

The party inches closer, preparing to attack, and readying weapons and spells. While looking for the creature, Tezzaran is spooked by something and fires a firebolt at the ground in front of G'rung, who leaps forward. 

~~~
Tezzaran: Sorry I thought I saw something by your foot. 
~~~

As G'rung lands, Vines burst up out of the ground beside the G'rung. A body that was stuck to this monster falls to the ground beside it and into the hole the creature came from.  
~~~
G'rung: Me found it. 
~~~
The party launches their initial salvo on the creature, hitting it with arrows ans spells. When Oriaanna fires a firebolt she notices that it does not much damage to it. 

Tezzaran noticing that fire had little effect reaches into his back and attempts to throw an acid vial at it but misses. Orianna switches to fire a Witch Bolt at the creature, but it only seems to heal some of the damage done by her previous firebolt. The vined creature take a step forward and bludgeoned G'rung with a big hit. Our three tiefling compatriots step forward to attack the creature. The G'rung rages and smashes the mound with his warhammer. Baka steps forwards and misses a Guiding Bolt but sidles into melee rage of the creature and heals G'rung. Bastion misses a longsword hit.

Tezzaran jogs forward to a spot where nobody is in front of the creature and misses another throw with an acid vial. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Ah pish. I'll just hit it with magic.
~~~

Oriaanna fires a magic missile at the creature. Our tiefling compatriots take small chunks out of it. Nightingale sneakily stabs the big creature in the back, and it shreaks, flailing it's vines falls back and collapses into the hole. 
~~~
G'rung: Me think it's dead.
~~~

G'rung is pretty sure it's dead, but is so angry at the mossy creature, he hits it anyway. The creature did not move. The party is still weary of the creature and Baka readies their weapon just in case, and the rest of the party in turns tries to check if the creature is dead, but it doesn't seem to be alive in the way we know it to be. The party thinks that perhaps the lightning storm before was responsible for animating this creature and that if the creature was going to move, some form of lightning could do so.

The tieflings underlings are happy it's dead and head off to the base of the tree with the person in it. It's Mormo, but when they ask him to get down shakes his head and stares at the creature intently. Nightingale syping the cowering Mormo pours oil over the creature and lights the oil. The oil burns, but the vegitiation of the creature doesn't seem to burn as well. Nightingale runs around to try and get more twigs to stoke the fire.  

Bastion and Tezzaran head over to the tree with Mormo in it. 
~~~ 
Tezzaran: Mormo, Are you still in the tree because you think the creature is not dead.
Mormo: It's done this before. It was very still from the time the scouts left until you arrived.
Tezzaran: OK! ... I think we should keep attacking it then. 
~~~
Oriaanna upon hearing this conversation walks up to the creature and fires a crossbow at the monster. It doesn't react. The tiefling underlings attempt to climb the tree to reach Mormo. Nightingale piles more wood on the fire to keep their fire going, and the moss and twigs on the creature starts turning grey. G'rung attacks again with the warhammer and the vines crumble like dead wood. 
~~~ 
G'rung: It's dead. Me know forest. You can come down now. 
~~~
Baka taps on the creature with their mace for good measure. Tezzaran wants to see how this creature dies for itself and hacks at the branches with his sickle. As he does this a body is revealed, which falls from creature and goes underneath the creature. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Oh there was a body here. Someone help me get it out before it burns!
~~~
G'rung bounces over to Tezzaran and they pull the body out from underneath before the fire hits it, but get some blowback from the spreading flames. Tezzaran tries to assess the condition of this man. 
~~~
Tezzaran: This one is alive! Baka heal this man! 
Baka: *walks over* This man is clearly dead. You probably need some 
Tezzaran: *Looking more closely and examining the body in more detail* How could I have missed this? Or this?
Baka: *proceeds to explain to Tezzaran features of this body, and why it is clearly dead*
~~~

While this is going on Nightingale makes a loop in one end of a rope and throws it into the trees to try and help Mormo get down. Mormo fails to get into the loop and catches the loop in the wrong way, partially falling out of the tree, but Astar manages to catch him before he smashes into the tree and Nightingale and G'rung slowly lower him to the ground. 

Tezzaran with something to prove comes over and rigorously examines Mormo. He finds all the physical ailments this time and (sucessfully) determines that he wouldn't have survived the night without medical help. He secures the leg in a splint and Oriaanna heals him. 
~~~ 
Tezzaran: This man needs proper medical attention, but in the meantime does anyone have any spare magic you can pump into this guy?
Tezzaran: Also Entropy, can you identify the other body as Robert so we can get out of here?
~~~

Entropy identifies the other body as Robert (Entropy doesn't seem all that fussed). After some prodding by G'rung, Entropy  and G'rung carry this body, Baka offers to join and is once again surprised at the strength of the frog. Tezzaran offers to make a makeshift stretcher out of the spears of the tiefling underlings and a bedroll, and Baka kindly offers theirs. He cobbles together a stretcher that isn't pretty and probably will fall apart after not too long, but will get the job done and with this, the tieflings and Bastion take Mormo and the party heads back into town.
