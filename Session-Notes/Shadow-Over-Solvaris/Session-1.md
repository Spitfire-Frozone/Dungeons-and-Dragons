# Shadow over Solvaris - Session 1 - 27/04/25

## Campaign Hook (Night 0 - Summer 1612)

### The Party MeetCute
The air is crisp and filled with the smell of starflowers. We are situated deep within a forest on in the clearing. This is the place that Prince Cedric told us to meet the paladin Danae. She stands alone on the hill waiting for the 4 other people the Prince sent invitations to to arrive. 

The first to arrive is Looney Tunes - Old Human Lady, she seems to have lost her marbles. After a tense greeting, Looney makes a snide remark and Danae takes an instant disliking to Looney. The awkwardness is thankfully broken soon after when another figure approaches the crest of the hill. 

The Tiefling called Mephina flitters up to Danae. She tells the gathered woman a bit about her backstory about how she was from royalty but fled her family at the castle and started a new more low-key life in Solvaris as a waitress.

~~~
Mephina: On this beautiful sunset it's nice to be on this hill. 
Looney: You both seem to have perky breasts
Denae: *To Looney* such a disgusting woman. 
~~~

Powerful steps echo up the path as Luthor is the next to introduce themselves, Luthor stands 6 feet tall, and has sandy yellow scaly skin. He is a Yuan ti, so a race of humanoid snake people, but their lower half has legs and not a snake. He is wary of the new people and introduces himself, gathers others names and then stays quiet.

The last of the party to join the meeting on the hill is a Black Bunny wearing a breast plate by the name of Conquest. They are from the city watch of Solvaris. With the arrival of you, Conquest, our party is complete.

~~~
Denae: Thank you for responding to the Prince's letter. My name is Danae, I will be your guide and assist you all on our quest.  In the ruins of Lunaris - the city that once was - there is a book that describes knowledge of the past that may well yet shape the future of this land. There is a darkness growing among this land and the information in this book could be key to solving our problems. We need to get it first because there are others with dark hearts who also seek it. If we do nothing all we love will be swallowed. You are Solvaris' best hope.  The road ahead is harsh and you need to trust each other. 


Luthor: Are we going to start our journey now or are we going to find somewhere to stay the night
Denae: We will need to sleep, we will leave at sunrise sharpish
~~~

As she finished speaking an Owl approaches from the forest and flies toward her. It was looking for a safe space for the party to camp for the night, and now Danae is guiding us to an old ruins for us to camp for the night. 

[...]

The area we aim for is a derelict stone ruin. Delicately engraved into every single stone near to where we setup there are swirling blue runes. They are engraved on the inside of these stone ruins, but they seem to be very old symbols - not like any language. Most of these runes are covered in moss. 

Conquest and Looney go to investigate. Conquest doesn't seem to notice anything off. Looney has a silver brooch that has the same symbols as these stones. She touches one of the stones, recognises this and then walks off briskly without saying anything.

~~~
Conquest: Hey, what did you see!
Danae: For the sake of this group can you support us with your wisdom?
Luthor: Are we in danger?
~~~

Looney is tight-lipped but she does indicate that we are safe to camp here, so the party get to work making a fire. 
Luthor cuts down a small tree and Conquest setup up a stone circle and then. The rest of the group organise the roster for watches and collects some kindling. 

### A Nighttime Ambush
Looney and Conquest are on the first watch. Looney is still a bit stiff from seeing the runes and is ringing her bells occasionally. She says that you can never be too careful. Conquest tries to stop her saying that she will attract unnecessary attention to the camp. 

During the first shift, the light tintinabulation from Looney persists, and soon Conquest hears just beyond the camp some very soft footsteps approaching the camp - not heavy enough to be an animal. Suddenly the forest is too quiet. Conquest wakes up the rest of the group. 

As they are stirring, an arrow comes out of the mist and hits Looney in the shoulder. A lone orc steps out of the mist. The group rally to fight this fucker.

> **COMBAT**
>
> Mephina fires an arrow at the that misses. Conquest leaps forward, blade wielded and now glowing a nice colour. He slashes at the orc and it looks in rough shape. Danae runs forward launching a javelin at the orc which spears him through the eye and, it falls back dead.
> ~~~
> Danae: Quick search this orc for contraband!
> ~~~
> Looney heals herself, steps forward and searches the orc. She finds 16 GP on the body and a bottle of mysterious fluid, which she pockets.
>
> but wait, there was more! 
>
> Another pair of orcs: a female and a male one, step out of the mist and attack their closest target Looney, they both miss (luckily). Luthor and Mephina hastily try to get into the fray but they are too far back. They both try to fire shots at the orcs and both miss. Danae rocks over and socks the female orc in the chest. She staggers back and tries to retaliate and misses. The male orc runs over and hits conquest. Luthor having seen enough goes into a rage and hacks at the male orc with his greataxe, cleaving his right arm off. Mephina steps in and again misses the orc.
>
> Conquest hops away out of the range of the female orc and aims an Eldrich blast at the her and misses. Danae launches an uppercut at the female orc with her battle axe and slashing upwards cleaves her in two from the vagina to the eyes. Looney casts Viscous mockery on the male orc.
>
> ~~~
> Looney: All your friends are dead, your girlfriend is dead 
> ~~~
>  *Looney's voice echoes and gets louder inside the orc's head* 
> Then his head explodes. 

We raid the bodies and discuss how to share the loot. After to-ing and fro-ing, we agree that our travel-guide paladin (this most trustworthy among us) keeps track of the group loot.

Mephina finds a very old tan leather piece of scrap on one of the orcs which depicts a dragon under a cresent moon. Danae has a map that is made of the same material, so we suspect that maybe it's over 500 years old.

Danae's map is special. It looks like the other maps of the area, but it has a bit of the map in detail that no other map has. When we overlap the map and the scrap, they look like they could be from the same place. like the same book.

This additonal secret detail is a spot close by Lunaris, an ancient stone near Lunaris which is said to hold a power, maybe this dragon is protecting the stone. The book we are looking for maybe tells us the power of this stone.

Looney trusting the party more she takes out the potion she picks up and offers it to the party for group loot, It's not a see-through. Luthor identifies it as Orcish Grog from the smell, and since it's a very heavy liquor is probably the only member of the party that can drink it. 

With that settled, everyone goes to sleep with Luthor taking the second watch. Nothing else happens during the night.

**DING DING DING**

## Day 1 - Summer 1612

### A camp full of bulging black wet orcs
There is a specific spot on this map marked that is close to the lost city of Lunaris. We head decide to head into the diection of Lunaris. 

Deeper into the forest the trees are twisted and knarled. Soon the road before us splits into two paths but only one of these roads on the map was shown.  One of the roads seems older, barely a soft path and a trail of leaves. The other is wider and straighter. In the distance the old path is just trees, on the new path there are wooden dwellings and some signs of fire some 3 kilometers away.

We go closer to the settlement, and notice that the path is wide enough for an army and is rather fresh, and the nearby trees have broken branches. On the ground there are footprints that look like the orcs we slaughtered but larger. Danae sends Gwyneth (her Owl) to check out the scene.

~~~
Danae: Do a quick fly by. Hoot once for friends and twice for enemies
~~~
Gwyneth comes back hooting twice, so we decide to investigate further.  

Conquest and Mephina (the stealthy peeps) go ahead another half kilometer, they a see around 20-25 individuals and around a 12-15 tents made out of animal and canvas in a circle. Orcs - different to the ones we saw last night (~30% larger, black and red coloured *`Editors Note: we thought our GM said wet here and that was not a pretty thing to visualise`*) - and Goblins are seen. There is one larger tent set apart from the others - (probably the leaders tent. There are captured prisoners tied to a post near the fire - 3 humanlike figures not moving. 

They come back and report their findings. Looney has heard of these larger Dennis-the-menace looking motherfuckorcs; they are Blood Orcs. These orcs  tend to be more aggressive. Parts of her family were slaughtered by them ages ago. They are not totally mindless and do trade with other races if they see themselves having an advantages. She also tells us that if we have kill the pack leader in single combat they rest will follow that person. We take stock of the situation and decide that since some of us barely escaped the common orcs with their lives, that this is too much for us, not in our mission, and we decide the best course of action is to turn back and take the other path.

###  The Story of the Stones
We backtrack back to the fork and after 20 minutes on the old path, we discover that this was in fact the correct path indicated as it follows the contours shown on the map. From time to time for small stone markers are passed. These stones have the markings found on the runes and on Looneys Broach. 

She refuses to say more and Danae is fed up with Looney and her crazy ass. She breathes and goes over to persuade her to be more useful. After a heart-to-heart Looney is still hestitant to talk about this in depth, but acquiesces to Danaes' charm. Looney says that these runes reminds her of her past and anything that reminds her of her past causes her trauma. So she doesn't want to talk about it because she doesn't want to relive it. She says that is looking for people, and this is the main reason why she joined the party. 

Danae feels the touch of the celestial presence just on the stone. Conquest sits down and casts a spell to attempt to read the stones, and succeeds so if he is in contact with the stones can decipher some of them. 

We walk along and try to decipher all the stones we can, but this slows the party's pace down.

> **What's on the Stones Part 1**
>
> [1 x] YOU DON‘T BELONG HERE! TURN AROUND!
> 
> [2] The other, a sister, quiet and vast.
> 
> [3] He came with a voice like flame and golden footsteps.
> 
> [4] Where he walked, the earth warmed, and morning rose in his gaze.His strength gave courage, his heart brought light.
 

Conquests asks Danae if this was any religious context. She says that it reminds her of a tale from the Temples of Solaris. The eternal flame. He knows of a man like this, but not of a sister. She tells us of a story.

~~~
Danae: While I don't know of a sister, these transcriptions about a brother are similar to one of the Gods spoken in the temple. 

 " He Being of light born of the breath of dawn ... his hands carried the stars ... those that followed him found strength ...  a trail of flame that never faded. "  
~~~


We use the Conquest's magic to decipher the inscriptions on the rest of the stones. There were 17 in total and Conquest was able to translate all but 3.

> **What's on the Stones Part 2**
>
> [4] She came with flowing silence and silver thoughts.Where she moved, stillness bloomed, and dreams stirred in her shadow.

###  Guardian of the Secret Code
It now late evening and we are looking for a place to camp. At the end of the path where the stones finish there is a hill. It seems like this is the location on the map that was hidden, some of the party expected to encounter upon Lunaris first. 

On this hill there is a well and 6 huge stones (double the height of the party) arranged in a circle with runs engraved on them. 
- C 
- O 
- X 
- D - Code for the backwards C
- 0 - identical to the first
- '-' The last stone has no visible markings on it

One of the symbols has the same symbol as the brooch (we'll call that the C one). Conquest reaches out and touches the stone with the same marks as the brooch, and the rune starts to glow and keeps glowing. We hit the other stones one by one, and upon their touch they light up and remain lit. Looney pokes the last blank stone with her walknig stick and nothing happens. Luthor presses his palm to the blank stone and the glow from all the stones vanish. Luthor then posits that the order in which the stones are touched matters and if you get it right and then hit the last one if the code is correct something will happen.

The party decide to guess a couple of logical orderings to press the stones, and if none of them work they will sit and think about it. 

Danae suggests presseing the stones in the order D,0,C,O,X,- (shorthand D0COX-) and it doesn't work. Luthor then suggests the ordering C0XOD- and this also doesn't work. Looney then tries OCXD0-. Upon pressing her hand against the final slate, all the other stones start to glow a different colour, light blue and then red. 

We hear a massive screeching as the earth starts to shake, stones are springing out of the earth and are coalescing in the form of an Emerald Golem. We enter combat

> **COMBAT**
> Luthor steps forward and makes a battle cry. He enters a rage and swings his battle axe into the creature connecting two strong attacks against the Golem. Conquest performs a Hexblades curse on the Golem and then attacks with a doomblade dealing a chunk of damage and the Emerald construct looks weakened. Looney inspires Mephina and then casts Faerie fire on the Golem - but the golem seems completely unaffected. Mephina uses her inspiration to fire off a crossbow shot into the Golem. Danae casts a thunderous smite and also makes two solid strikes against the creature, though the damage from the thunder seems to have unfazed the lumbering creauture 
> 
> The golem turns and punches the creature that hurt it the most. This is Luthor, but the attack was easily shrugged off. 
> 
> ~~~
> Luthor: you call that a hit! Hahah, that's nothing
> ~~~
> Luthor swings his axe and takes the right leg of the Emerald Golem clean off. The beast now defeated falls over into the ground shattering into about into 50 pieces.

Luthor walks over and would to take the Golems's core. The Golems core is a weighty shard of a glowing silver stone serving as the power source of the Golems magic. It is heavy, but if anyone can carry this thing around, it's Luthor. Conquest takes an emerald shard lying around, and Looney takes some emerald golem dust into one of her backpack pockets. 

With the beast slain it's time for a good nights sleep.
