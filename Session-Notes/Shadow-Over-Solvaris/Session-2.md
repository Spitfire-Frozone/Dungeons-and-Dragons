# Shadow over Solvaris - Session 2 - 18/05/25

## Day 1 - Evening 1612

### The Rocky aftermath

Luthor wants to test the stones still work. Luthor presses on the stone closest to him, the C, and it glows again. He then touches the X and they both glow so he goes in a clockwise direction and touches them all. They turn blue and go off CXOD0-

We try the combination (OCXDO-) that summoned the Golem, the stones glow red and turn off (no other Golem appears).

We realise that the blank stone also acts like the others, and doesn't need to be pressed last. We try to come up with the logic that could lead to an ordering of the stones.

Luney tries CODOX- :Light blue and then off. Conquest tries the combination which is almost the reverse of the one that summoned the Golem, but still with the blank slate last:  0DXCO- Again they Glow all light blue and turn off

At this point the party gives up all formal logic and just tries combinations they are vibing with (after an intense discussion beforehand) that could be roughly related to the phases of the moon.

Luney: -CXO0D
Luthor: -OCXD0 
Luney: 0x-COD
Luthor: -XDO0

After a couple of hours of this the party have lost track of what they have tried. 
Mephina: OCXD0- (again)
Luney:  C0XOD- (again)

By this time it is getting late and the sun has set. Luthor suggests that the go to bed and like last night take turns on a watch system, but this time we also look at the moon and see how it interacts with the stones. He tries one last combination (-O0CDX) before settling down to get ready to sleep.

Conquest then goes off on his own into the trees, he says that needs to wee. 

When the reaches the treeline, he slips out of view and takes out the emerald shard he retrieved from the fight with the Golem, places it on the ground and starts to pray. 
~~~
Conquest: My lady of the Caves, I present this shard as a token of my adventure, I hope you find joy in this sacrifice, and maybe you can guide me and my companions in this mystery. 
~~~
A hole opens up and the shard disappears into it, then Conquest hears a light voice 
~~~
~*The stone does not bloom when struck, it waits and shapes the world in stillness*~
~~~
Conquest head his way back to the camp, and the rest of the party pile in on how long he took.
~~~
That was a long piss. 
Number 1 or number 2?
Did you take a shit?
Did you bury it?
Are you getting enough fiber?
~~~

Conquests ignores all of it

The rest of the party goes to sleep while Conquest is scheduled to take the first watch. He sees the moon rise. Now past midnight the moon is above the centre of the hill, and the stones look different in the moonlight. 

The blank slate (-) looks like a empty circle
The cresent moons (C and D) have the rest of their circles filled in
The cross (X) is now surrounded by a full circle 
The empty circle (0) now has an X going through it
The O remains unchanged, though in the moonlight it looks full. 

There isalso something written on the floor in a circle that is now only visible.
> We wax and wane, we rise and fall, we mark the path from dusk to dawn, place us true from birth to breath to silent death and the dreamers gate shall open


Conquest wakes up Danae and says that the stones have changed. Danae tells Conquest to wake up Luthor and Mephina, she says that Luney needs her rest. 

The party then get into discussion about what the moonlight revelations means for the correct ordering of the stones. Danae says that Lunaris was often called the city of dreamers and thinks that the X represents the death?

While the party is deep in discussion Conquest wakes up Luney. The party decides that since there is no time on how fast the stones need to be pressed they can work slowly. Conquest volunteers to press all of the stones this time. They assume that from birth means a new moon, and that the blank stone, now displaying an empty circle is the one that should be pressed first (-).

When conquest presses the stone, the stone is glowing, but now in the moonlight it's glowing the same shimmering bluey-green colour as the markings. 

The party deliberates on the rest markings. They believe that the waxing moon is next. Luthor identifies the waxing moon as the (D) marked stone. Then the X with a full circle (X) for the full moon, (C) (for the waning moon), and then (0) the fully blank circle to represent the 'death' of the moon (-DXOC0).

Conquest presses each of these in turn and they glow one by one, but after he presses the (C) stone and the (C) stone glows, the stones then stop glowing. As he goes to press the last one (0), a portal opens and he gets sucked inside the stone. 

~~~
Luthor: CONQUEEEEEEEEST!
*runs straight into the portal*
~~~
The rest of the party shrug their shoulders and shortly follow suit.

### Inside the portal
The light shifts and the world is suddenly brighter, illuminated by a strange eerie glow from strong moonlight. The land itself is wreathing. The earth underfoot catches the light like glass in water, shifting from green to blue shifting with every breath of the wind.  It seems like the party is in a different realm. in front of them, rising from the ground, are trees with bark as white as snow, that look smoothe to the touch. They are adorned with leaves of silver blue. 

As the rest of the party catch up to Conquest and Luthor, behind them is only one stone - the portal we entered. Everything seems like it was touched by moonlight, and it feels like looking through silky fabric.

A grove of trees sit on both sides of a path that runs straight directly ahead. Venturing to the side seems impossible, some mysterious force compels you to return to the path. The trees are packed in and too dense to stay in.  

Conquest decides to climb a tree - forwards in the distance, there seems to be something that resembles a nest or some dwelling for creatures with a giant stone in the middle. as he is descending the tree, he palms a couple of the silver-blue leaves. While Conquest is climbing down the leaves shimmer but when he touches the ground they disappear, much to his bemusement. 

The party decide that they will complete the rest of their night's rest here, and explore this nest in the morning. They venture towards the trees and use them as cover and resume the night watch, with Luthor staying up this time. 

### Another nighttime ambush!
During his watch, Luthor gets the feeling that something or someone is watching him, he doesn't know what it is, and he can't see it. He doesn't wake anyone up but becomes super vigilant. As he starts to yawn and his shift draws to a close, an arrow flies through the air and hits him, a rising heavy drowsiness washed over him, and Luthor shouts to wake everyone up, saying that he has been attacked, and points in the direction in which he thinks the arrow came from - the other grove of trees. He then keels over, hits the ground with a thus, and cannot move, he seems paralysed.

Why the party is still waking up and panicking, another arrow comes from the shadows and hits Mephina, she stumbles, but remains upright.  Luney casts fairy fire in the direction of the arrows, and ends up illuminating a Tiefling mounted on a Stag who comes and fires another shot. Danae is hit, and she and Mephina hit the floor in close sucession.

Luney turns invisible. Conquest summons a black blade and calls out to the foe!
~~~
Conquest: Who are you why are you attacking us
???: Who are you why are you on my lands
Conquest: We are adventurers from Solvaris
???: I haven't heard of that name in centuries
~~~
She readies her bow and points in Conquests direction, she motions to him to keep talking. 

~~~
Conquest: We are looking for the city of Lunaris
???: Lunaris, is not a city, but a being. The city of it's namesake fell in a war some 500 years ago. 
Conquest: A darkness has falled upon our land. The price suspects that there is a book that can help the country and fight this darkness. 
???: A darkness, what kind of darkness?
Conquest: It is a darkness that infiltrates peoples minds, creatures have vanished and gone bad, turned evil.
???: My name is Velanira, I am the sole protector of Lunaris, the ancient Dragon. I watch over her. It is she that is the giver of the name of the place.
Conquest: My friends, are they safe?
Valerina: Yes, they are just sleeping.
* Conquest plunges his black sword into the ground * 
~~~
Conquest goes over to Danae's fallen body and pulls out the ancient scrap from her pocket. He describes our adventures to Velanira
~~~ 
...
Velanira: So how did you get here? 
Conquest: We used the portal
Velanira: Nobody has used the portal in 500 years. 
Conquest: We had to fight and defeat the Golem that protected it. 
Velanira: Oh so you are rather strong then. 
Conquest: So how about you, why are you the only survivor?
Velanira: I started my guard of Lunaris 600 years ago, I came from a family that used to serve the cities founder. There were shadows lurking around the city, and then one day, city was one day beset by them. We had to flee quickly and be safe, and not many people made it out.  For my appearance, an infernal corruption in my bloodline meant I turned into the being you see before me.
Conquest: This could be the same thing happening in Solvaris
Valenira: Rumours were circulating that people were turning into shadows. We realised too late, and coudln't act in time. 

Velanira: Should I wake them or will they be angry? 
Conquest: Are there any other things in this meadow that could jump us?
Velanira: The field is now safe, and your friends will wake normally in the morning
Conquest: Then it's probably best to let them stay down or they might attack you. 
Velanira: Very well then *glances around*, aha,  the portal - oh you left it open I will is close it for you.
Conquest: If you close it, can we get back?
Velanira: Yeah from this side it's easy to open. *clicks fingers* 
**The portal closes**
~~~
Velanira returns to her place, when she is out of sight Luney pops out of invisibility. She doesn't trust her because she is too powerful. She doesn't want to go to sleep just yet. Luney takes the next watch 

During the watch, she hears an owl noise coming from the top of the trees. She glances up, looks closely, and makes out a large being sitting in the trees. She doesn't recognise it, but its staring at the party. It had the body of an large owl, antler horns, and dragon wings. She looks at it for a while, returning its gaze, but the creature seems to not do anything but observe. 

Luney falls asleep

## Day 2 - Morning 1612
Luthor jolts up wakes up on edge. Conquests, wearily freshly awake, updates Luthor and the rest of the party that endured a forced slumber about what happened after they passed out. Luthor relaxes a bit. Luney describes the creature she saw while she was on watch.

As we decide to go see Velanira, she appears in front of us. Happy that we are not a threat, she tells us a bit about herself. She says that Lunaris are her are the only survivors of the war that ravaged the city - and in this realm they are surrounded by friends such as the creature that Luney tells Velanira was watching us last night. That creature is (a/the) Kipine. 

Noticing that Mephina is also a tiefling, Velanira asks her to tell her her story. 

~~~
Mephina: I used to be royalty, but I ran away from home after turned into a tiefling
Velanira: Why?
Mephina: I had mental intrusion at my coming of age party. I has a vision about the Devil? and the deal her family made with him with long ago. It was an evil being of immense power. After this vision, she turned into an tiefling and was forced to flee.
~~~
*Velanira is visibly unconfortable* - she sighs and has a face racked with guilt.
~~~
Velanira: An ancient amount of time ago - When the shadows appeared, she made a deal with an infernal being from another realm in an attempt to save the city. We thought it was the only escape from the shadows, but I was tricked - We made a huge mistake and in actual fact we sealed the downfall of the city. You are probably seeing that pact. My entire bloodline was cursed.
Mephina: So I am your ancector 
Velanira: Looks like it
~~~
Velanira invites us to meet Lunaris. As we get closer to the nest-like structure that Conquest saw, The giant stone in the city was in fact not a stone but Lunaris herself, she is the same colour as the surroundings. As we near the ancient dragon Velanira makes an introduction. 
~~~
Velanira: This is the queen; The ancient moon dragon of Lunaris.  
Lunaris: Hello, it's been a while since I saw beings what do you seek
~~~
*Lunaris speaks, her voice resonates through the air and it seems like there is a telepathically echo* 

~~~
Conquest: Cedric the current Prince of Solaris sent us no a quest.
Lunaris: Prince? Where is the King of Solaris, the King of Solaris is my brother. 
Danae: The king has been missing for as long as I remember, nobody knows what he looks like
Conquest: Is he a dragon too?
Lunaris: No, he's an Angel. I have not heard from her brother in 500 years. The last time I saw him was in Lunaris. 
Conquest: Are Angels immortal? 
Lunaris: Yes Solaris is immortal. 
Conquest: Prince Cedric now rules in his place. We were told by him that at in Lunaris there was a book with knowledge that could help us combat the shadows.
Lunaris: Hmm, there might be one book that is hidden in the palace of Lunaris. It is the book of the Great Wizard Himself, Tesh' Celpide. Everything he learnt and invented was in this book. Everything about the city history and the country, and everything we learnt about the great shadow. 
Luthor: Your majesty, please forgive my bluntness, but if this book hold keys to defeat the shadows, why haven't you seek it out before?
Lunaris: When the city fell, the shadows came from everywhere. The shadow overwhelmed everyone so suddenly, that escaping was the only priority, besides I cannot fit inside the room that stored the book.
Velanira: The only thing we managed to do is cast a binding magic, which means that the Shadow cannot escape the city. Neither of us have been back for 500 years, so we have no idea what you will encounter in the city. 
Luthor: Do you have a map of the city, and you mentioned a barrier, will be have to do anything to get into the city?
Lunaris: I can give you this. *hands Luthor a map* 
Luthor: Is there a seal on the city we need to break?
Lunaris: You have everything you need 
~~~
Lunaris also offers the party anohter goft, she asys that if we have a vessel, that she will give the party a tear drop from herself. It has many healing properties including the power to cleanse the deepest Evil. Conquest takes out a crystal vial and gives it to the Dragon she fills it *Tear of Lunaris*  
~~~
Lunaris: If you don't have any further questions, I must take my leave. I grow tired. 
~~~
Despite protests from the other members of the party, Luney steps forward and beseechex the dragon for more gifts. **Editors Note - gib more plox bitch**. Lunaris does not seem to take this well, and looks at Luney with a look of scorn and mild disgust. She breathes deeply 
~~~
Lunaris: You wear your past like a cloak of feathers, and masks. But child...
The moon never hides, it only wanes. You do not need to vanish to be safe, let them see who you are and they will follow your light. 
~~~

Luney shows the Lunaris her brooch. The Dragon says that it's the holy symbol of the City of Lunaris, which bears the crest of Lunaris. Luney's ancestors must have lived in the city. She says that because of this she is on this quest seeking her own answers and not really here for the same reason as the rest of us. Luney says she trusts the party enough now and removes her persona to reveal...
~~~
Luney: I am Princess Sonneh, Aunt of Prince Cedric and Sister of the Queen. 
Sonneh: At the time of the fall, Solaris saved me and my sister, but my husband and daughter were not able to be rescues and were left behind in the city. I needs to go back to Lunaris and learn of their fate. 
Luthor: *Goes over to her and kisses her hand*  Why did you hide from us Princess?
Sonneh: I made a promise to the late queen, that I would travel under a disguise and keep her secret.
Luthor: Thank you for trusting us with your secret. This love you have for your family over the centuries you have lost them - it's s rare love that needs to be treasured. I will promise to fight to protect your secret and find the child you have loved and lost.
Conquest: It's an honour to meet another member of the Royal family. 
~~~

The party bows to the Great Dragon and finally takes their leave. We head for the portal and Velanira opens it, the party bade her farewell and step through.

## Day 2 - Morning 1612
Time moved slightly slower in the other realm. When we exit the portal, its the morning after the night we left. While we seem to have teleported back into same forest, there are no large stones in sight. In a bit to gain a bearing, Conquest climbs a nearby tree. He sees water to the North-West and the orc settlement to the East, which we seem close to. We regain our place on the old map follow it, going quietly in the direction of Lunaris, which happens to be North west by the lake. 

A little while away we hear some very loud angry growling sounds. There are bears in the distance. Before the bears come into view Sunneh casts invisibility on Mephina and bardic inspiration on Luthor. When the two bears come into view, they seem corrupted by emerald stone. We ready for battle. 

>**COMBAT**
> Conquest casts Booming Blade charging at the closest bear, but his swing bounced off the hide of the bear. Luthor enters into a rage and for the first time the party sees his blue-ish white ghostly ancestors surround him. He enters the fray against the first bear and swings his greataxe getting two solid hits on the creature, dealing additional bardic inspiration and thunder damage inspired by Sunneh. 
> 
> 
> Danae casts searing smite on a javelin and launches it at the other bear, it hits it square in the shoulder and it tanks it, charging at Danae. It lunges for her swinging a heavy paw and a gnashing bite at Danae but both miss. Luney casts fairy fire on the first bear, and it now has dancing coloured lights around it, making it easier to hit.
> 
> The first bear tears into Luthor biting into his shoulder and slashes a claw at him. Both attacks hit and Luthor staggers back a bit recoiling from the large amount of damage he just took. Mephina not seeing a clear shot strafes to the side and fires a  firebolt at the first bear, it lands between it's eyes - a critical shot! The bear is now screaming in pain, but this also seems to be enraging it. Conquest casts a hex on the bear in front of him, now slightly on fire and growling in pain. In addition to the ember glows of the fire (which is slowly dying out) the bear has an eerie red glow for a brief instant. The booming blade strikes at the first bear, and after connecting, there is an additional flickering black aura around the first bear. Luthor takes a step around the backside of the bear and attacks and cleaves at the bear, the bear looks very weak, but it's still on its feet and has life left in it.
> 
> Danae currently in melee with the second bear by herself swings twice at the bear connecting two masterful strikes. The bear tries to respond with a bite, but misses. However the bear catches Danae with a claw swipe which slashes against her chest. Sonneh gives bardic inspiration to Mephina, and then steps forward to cast Vicious mockery on the first bear, but its too dumb to understand the insults, and the attack fails. 
> 
> The first bear tries to attack Conquest, a big mistake. Luthor having successfully attacked the bear last turn, now has the translucent ancestors of his impairing the vision, and distracting the bear, so the bear misses both of its attacks. Mephina fires another firebolt at the first bear, which sets the bear afire and keels over, finally put out of it's misery. 
> 
> Conquest moves the hexblades curse to the second bear, and runs over to the second bear plunging his doomblade into the front left shoulder. A necrotic puss seeps from this fresh wound. Luther still raging, also runs into the second bear and hacks at the back of the second bear slashing and cleaving at the bear, two solid hits are dealt and the bear looks weary. The ancestors focus their attention on it. Danae takes out her great axe and slashes at the second bear twice, the bear tries to retaliate, but the Luthors ancestors block its vision and it misses. With the party surrounding the remaining bear, Mephina breathes in steadies her aim to give her a better shot at the bear, but still misses.
> 
> Conquest launches an assault into the second bear with booming blade again. The wounds fester with a necrotic aura. Luthor missed his greataxe swing, temporarily dissipating his guardians (maybe they are disappointed). Danae hits one of two attacks against the bear. The bear annoyed by the festering wounds, turns towards Conquests and sinks its teeth into Conquests non-attacking arm. Sunneh casts dissonant whispers on the bear and it connects with the creature, after taking damage, it's writhes in terror and tries to run to flee. The party take this opportunity to attack the creature, but it's Conquest who gets the first attack off, and after slashing at the back of the fleeing creature, the black necrotic line across the creature explodes and it falls down dead.
