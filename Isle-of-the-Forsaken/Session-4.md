# Isle of the Forsaken - Session 4 - 27/10/21

## Day 6 (Monday April 19th) Part 3 - Weather: Sunny with Moderate Wind.
As the party returns to the village. They hear some quiet talking off to one side, and find another party walking, not making any real attempt to be stealthy. 
~~~
Nightingale: (!) <The alert noise from metal gear solid>
~~~
Entropy says that given the time this is most likely the other forraging party returning to the village. Nightingale, wanting to investigate themselves, goes through the brush and sees 6 people walking along, carrying sacs of things, and wearing sickles. Satisfied that the party seems to be who Entropy says they were, she rejoins the party. 
~~~
Mormo: If that is the other party, can we walk into town with them? 
~~~
Hearing this the G'rung hails the other party.
~~~
G'rung: Hellooo.
Other party: helloooo?
Tezzaran: Hey, we have Entropy with us, don't worry we're friendly. 
Entropy: Hey it's ok. They are with me. 
~~~
The other party cautiously approaches, sickles out but relax when they see Entropy is ok. There are 2 humans and 4 tieflings. One of the tieflings, Seere, runs over to Mormo, and one of the humans runs over to Robert. Seere, after inspecting Mormo all over, then goes over to Entroy and barrages them with questions and seeking answers.  

Seeing Entropy overwhelmed with the questions from Seere, Tezzaran steps in to inform her, and the rest of the new group of the trials of the forest. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Hi, sorry to bother you, I'm Tezzaran, we joined this party as they went on an expedition to the forest ...
~~~
Tezzaran explains to the party the incidents that befell them since they arrived in the town. That they met the runners of the hunt in the town, that they joined with Entropy at the church and head to the forest to look for the rest, and these were those that were left behind in the forest. Sadly Robert was dead when we found him (Cersei cries some more), but as he was patched up, Mormo should be fine if we get him to the village. 

After this explanation, Oriaanna goes over to console the grieving daughter (Cersei). 
~~~
G'rung: It was good death. He died in the best way. He a hunter. 
Tezzaran: Shh G'rung, probably not the best way.
G'rung: NO! Tez'ran. He a hero. I am hon'ring this man.
Tezzaran: I agree ... but the time for honouring this mans death G'rung is not now.

Oriaanna: While not put in the best way, I think my friend was trying 
Cersei: *cheers up a little bit*
~~~

~~~
Seere: Where's Damacos?
Tezzaran: Who is Damacos? What does he look like?
Seere: <Explains what Damacos looks like>
Tezzaran: Apologies. We saw some members of the party before we left for the forest. Though the last time I saw him, he was definately shy of an arm. 
Seere: What?
Baka: Something removed his arm.
~~~

### Arrival in the Village

Upon arriving in the village, the party heads to the church. Damacos is sitting on a pew with Jaasmal (his partner).  Chandri and Lukas are still around. Ceidl (Robert's Wife) goes over to Cersei by Robert's body and busts into tears. Oriaanna goes around to Cersei and Ceidl to comfort them. Nightingale slips outside to chill in the graveyard. Entropy and G'rung take the body to the back room (there was a child in there, and they scarpered when the G'rung entered), and Entropy goes to the corner. G'rung holds their head down near the body. Baka offers their medical skills to help Damacos and Mormo. Tezzaran makes a splint for Mormo's leg. Bastion is standing guard by the entrance.

Vezmoba (Lozodon healer) says that Cersei and Ceidl should go to the back room with Robert's body. Oriaanna comforts and eventually guides Cersei and Ceidl there (but they didn't appreciate the way Oriaanna said it). Cersei and Ceidl enter the room. Cersei cuddles the body of Robert and Ceidl puts her hand on Cersei's shoulder. The room quietens and everyone turns to look at the stranger. G'rung shifts awkwardly but starts to speak. 
~~~
G'rung: Me know now hard it is to lose kin, but he was good man. I know you say he too old, but in my time the wisest hunters keep everyone safe. Without him ... maybe others not make back. Other hunter ... the one with the broken leg [Entropy: Mormo] Mormo ... said he saved them. He would not have survived witout him ... He hero. 
~~~
Ceidl puts a hand on G'rungs shoulder to thank him, but as she touched him she recoils. 
~~~
Ceidl: I would give you a hug, but your skin feels weird. 
G'rung: Is ok. Tez'ran tell me no hug.  
Ceidl: Thank you for your kind words. 
~~~

G'rung leaves the room with Entropy, and Cersei and Ceidl follow them out the door and partially close the door behind them.

Tezzaran goes over asks to Damacos and Chandri to ask where our party can stay in the night, since it's been a long day for us. We are directed to The Rivers Bounty by Damacos, but as he starts giving directions, Chandri interrupts and says that was where they met our party. Damacos then starts to ask to Tezzaran asks about the events of the day. He asks for more details about the creature. 
~~~
Damacos: Do you know what it was.
Tezzaran: Some sort of vegiriatove mound thing. I have never seen one of those before. We suppose it arrive or was animated by the lighning storm that befell this town a while back. 
Damacos: Is the creature dead?
Tezzaran: Well, I'n not an expert, but after we killed it, the creature dissolved to ash. In my experience, creatures do not come back from that process.
Damacos: My experience is similar. Was Robert dead when you found him. 
Tezzaran: By the time he got there he had already been partially assimilated into the creature, but when we managed to pull him out he was dead. Not sure if he was alive while in the creature but I assume the assimilation process was fatal.
Damacos: How easy was it to defeat?
Tezzaran: While still the creature was hard to spot, and liked to play dead. We had very little trouble, but there were 9 of us. Mormo probably knows more about this. 
Damacos: I have already spoken to Mormo, thank you for healing Mormo. It would have been a shame if my daughters partner died. 
~~~
Damacos asks Tezzaran if they would accompany us on a hunt tomorrow. Jasmaal comes in and admonishes Damacos for this.
~~~
Tezzaran: How pressing is the need for a second hunt. 
Bastion: That was not the main objective of the party when we arrived. 
Tezzaran: Agreed. I think we will have to discuss this as a party this evening, preferably over a stiff drink. 
Bastion: I would like to see this stiff drink.
Damacos: We have a riverweed ale
Tezzaran: I shall look forward to trying it, but I cannot commit us to cause without a discussion first .
Damacos: I understand
~~~
Damacos tell us he lives next to the carpenters Jasmaal's Joinery ( We should shop there as the other one in town is Nailed run by Raandaal and Jasmaal). He says that he will have an emergency meeting of the town elders to see if they can reward us for killing the monster. In either case, he will swing by the the tomorrow morning with their decision and to hear the party's decision on whether to accompany tomorrows hunt. 

~~~
G'rung: Baka, what is this? *points all around him*
Baka: It is a constructed cave. It is a place for people to participate in a shared belief. Do you belief in a god or a deity -- a great and poweful deity that controls your future?
G'rung: ... Yes. My forebears.
Baka: I belief in Koseth, the living flame, and I channel his power into my words.
G'rung: You descend from flame? 
Baka: That is where I come from.
G'rung: You no look like flame.
~~~

Baka asks Vezmoba what gods are followed in this place. He is told that there are three major deities worshipped in the town. Meleki of the forest who is worshipped by the foragers and the carpenters; Sylvanas, the god of wild nature whose symbol is an oak leaf \[It was his will that this mound thing accosted us\]; and Domona, the goddess of rivers and healing whose symbol is of a river meandering in the forest. Baka and G'rung go over the alter and share a blessing. These latter two deities are worshipped by everyone in the town. 

Baka takes the G'rung over to the altar and offers a blessing to the local deities and Koseth. Baka uses simple language to get G'rung to understand, and G'rung nods silently along. 


Upon seeing more and more people leave the church, and that things are startgin to wind down, Tezzaran directs the party to go the Rivers Bounty and picks up Nightingale who found the church too crowded for her taste. She was outside drawing a sketch of the town. Tezzaran gives it a perusal and offers some words of encouragement about the piece as he holds up the work against the horizon.

~~~
Tezzaran: We're going to the Rivers Bounty.
Nightingale: <General hubbub of noises you'd find in a crowded place> *tilts head to the side questioningly*
Tezzaran: Yes, but I don't know whether the place is going to be busy.
Nightingale: *raises hood and shrinks a bit* 
~~~

### The Rivers Bounty

In the Rivers Bounty, the place is rather busy. There is a very noticeable white-skinned red-haired tiefling running around (Barakas) behind the bar. The place looks too busy for just one person to be running things. The party makes their way over to the bar, and Nightingale immediately goes off to the quietest place she can find, a small table with one seat. Bastion follows her and stands beside the table. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Hello!
Barakas: Very busy. I need to serve him, him, them and then them, and then I'll get to you. 
Tezzaran: That's fine. I'm happy to wait.
~~~
Tezzaran offers to buy a round of drinks for everyone, and asks people what they want. 
~~~
Baka: I'll have a wine please, but can you make it warm? 
Oriaanna: A wine for me as well please.
Tezaran: I think I'll try that ale that Damacos recommended. 
Tezaran: What about Nightingale and Bastion?
Oriaanna: *Goes over to the where Nightingale and Bastion are* Would you like a drink?
Bastion: I would like the stiff drink please.
Nightingale: seeeing everyone else in the place has at least one glass in front of them *nods head*
Oriaanna: What would you like, ale?
Nightingale: *shrugs indifferently*
Oriaanna: Wine?
Nightingale: *shrugs indifferently*
Oriaanna: Liquor?
Nightingale: *completely lost*
Passing bartender: I think you'll find it's either ale or water. Where do you think we grow the grapes to make wine?
Oriaanna: *walks back to the bar* They only do ale or water here. 
Tezzaran: 6 Riverweed ales it is! Oriaanna, you don't look so pleased about this.
Oriaanna: It's fine I'll have a ale. 
Tezzaran: Is this fine with you Baka?
Baka: As long as it's warm.
~~~
Baka and Oriaanna go over to where Nightingale and Bastion are and pull a nearby table over and draw chair for everyone. While G'rung joins Tezarran at the bar.
~~~
G'rung: Tez'ran what is buy?
Tezzaran: Looks down at the Grung <a sigh of wonder> ...
Tezzaran: Say you have some moss, and someone else has sticks. You want their moss, and they want your sticks. Yes?
G'rung: Yes?
Tezzaran: You would swap your moss for their sticks, yes
G'rung: Me like swapping moss for sticks. 
Tezzaran: Ok, if you don't have any moss, but want the sticks, you can still swap with something else yes? 
G'rung: Yees?
Tezzaran: Like for example ... these *shows a copper, silver and gold coin* If you swap with coin its called buying.
G'rung: Oki
Tezzaran: Not everywhere has sticks but most people carry these coins. Do you have some of these on you?
G'rung: Yes. Can I buy?
Tezzaran: Sure! *pulls up a stool and points to it*
G'rung: *hops on the stool, and seeing the bar for the first time* oooh!
Tezzaran: So we are ordering these drinks *points to the barrels*.
~~~
The bartender has now finished serving everyone and heads over to Tezzaran. 
~~~
Barakas: Apologies for the wait. Other bar staff had a loss in the family, so I'm here all alone. What can I get you?  
Tezzaran: 6 Riverweed ales please! Is it possilbe to warm one of those up? Or are they served at a particular temperature?
Barakas: All our ales are served at room temperature. I guess I can put it on the stove? How hot do you want it?
Tezzaran: The stove is fine, just under boiling is probably ok.  
Barakas: That will be two silver please. 
Tezzaran: *nods to G'rung*
G'rung: Here *about to hand over two gold pieces*
Tezzaran: Wait!
Barakas: <sighs> *shrugs shoulders, starts pouring drinks* 
Tezzaran: Do you have any of these *hold up a silver piece*
G'rung: *searches his pockets* No
Tezzaran: Ah, it just that this gold piece can be swapped for many of these silver pieces, and our friend here is asking for two of these *points to the silver pieces* not two of those *points to the gold piece the Grung is holding*
Tezzaran: I'll get these then *hands over two silver pieces to Barakas*.
~~~
While returning from the bar, Tezzaran spies Astar making eyes at Entropy who is sat drinking at a different table.
~~~ 
Tezzaran: Honestly, just go talk to them.
Astar: *shifts awkwardly and stares intently into his drink*
~~~

Tezzaran and G'rung reach the table and hand everyone their drink
~~~
Bastion: *upends drink* That wasn't very stiff. 
Tezzaran: (ahh, note to self). I think the stiffness meant that the drink has alcohol in it, as opposed to the property of the liquid itself. 
Bastion: Understood. Perhaps we should freeze it next time, as an experiment.
~~~

The ale is relatively inconsistent and some of the party detect a fishy aftertaste. Oriaanna grimaces at the taste. G'rung quickly finishes his drink, and want to buy more. Before G'rung hops off, Tezzaran exchanges one of G'rung gold pieces for ten of his silver pieces. 
~~~
Tezzaran: One of those will be enough for you to buy another. 
G'rung: *goes off to buy another drink and hops on the bar*
Barakas: Hey, hey HEY! Get down from there, 
G'rung: *hops onto the floor* 
Barakas: I assume that you want another drink?
G'rung: *sheepishly* yes
~~~
Barakas pours a drink from the barrel, and hands it down to the grung. He offers out his hand. The G'rung hands a silver piece over.
~~~
Barakas: hey, wait! Your change.
G'rung: *looks confused as he receives 6 copper pieces* oki
~~~
As G'rung returns to the table Tezarran teaches cheers-ing to the G'rung but Grung is too vigourous in his gesture, and smashed his glass into Tezzaran's causing Tezzaran's glass to crack, but the G'rungs to shatter, and shards of glass embedd the frogs skin. Tezzaran puts on his gloves and helps take the shards out, but some of the shards scratch the frogs skin as he is taking them out. 
~~~
G'rung: OOW!
Tezzaran: Sorry, stop moving.
~~~
A short man comes over to the table to clean the glass. He says that this happens reasonably often when people get drunk, and say he will get it reblown at the glassbower. 


The party has a discussion about what their long terms goals are. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Damacos asked us to help with the hunt tomorrow, and I didn't want to commit us to a cause. What are all of our objectives/goals?
G'rung: I want find out who took us and why? Find them, we kill them.
Oriaanna: Surely we want to understand more about these people. We know they worked for other people.
G'rung: Fine. We find them, we talk them, we kill them.
Bastion: I require information. Preferably from a large library. 
Tezzaran: Is it for a purpose larger than this?
Bastion: Yes.
Oriaanna: Well I was interested in visiting this part of the world for work reasons?. 
Tezzaran: What kind of work do you do?
Oriaanna: I work for troubled individuals in my city. I sort of work fostering relations between parts of the city, and other cities. 
Tezzaran: So like an ambassador?
Oriaanna: Yes, that's a very good way of putting it. I'm currently on an ambassadorial role.
Tezzaran: And you Baka, I know you knew Oriaanna from before so are your goals similar? 
Baka: Well I here to protect my friend Oriaanna, who is here on a work trip. 
Tezzaran: Ok. As for myself. I'm interested in adventure, and in no hurry to return but I'm with G'rung. That question about why were specifically were chosen irks me. I need answers. *Gets out the map* I guess in the short term I would like to decipher this and orient myself. 
Party: *starts to turn attention to Nightingale*
Nightingale: *suddenly stabs the map in a particular spot* 
Tezzaran: I assume you have business there.
Nightingale: < Not talking again? Let's see if you are more chatty after a few more days without food >
Tezzaran: That is disgusting. 
Oriaanna: That is terrible. I'm so sorry.
Tezzaran: So Baka and Oriaanna want to stay, but I guess the thing potentially stopping us is Bastion's library search, and Nightingale's quest. There's a library in Malacham ... but it's not open acess. Lets put it this way I've never been inside.
Oriaanna: I know Dimadorf has a library, and it's large. Anyone can use it. Happy to help you out Bastion.
Bastion: It is not immediately pressing. 
Tezzaran: Is this *pointing to the dagger* something that you need to do now Nightingale?
Nightingale: *shakes head*
Oriaanna: *Talking to the table generally* I will be happy to help you all in these quests
Party: <General acclaims of affirmation and secondary offers in a similar vein>
Tezzaran: But then, in response to Damacos' request. I assume we are happy to stay and help?
Party: <General acclaims of affirmation>
Tezzaran: That settles that, I'll inform Damacos in the morning. 
Nightingale: *prises the dagger from the map*
~~~
The party gets food from the bar. Nightingale peels off and goes fishing in the river. 

After food, the party settles down in rooms for the night. Baka asks for a cellar to sleep in and is put in the area where the beer is made, and G'rung is put up in the communal bathtub, which is filled with water. Given the amount of alcohol G'rung has drunk, the party are mildly worried, but when questioned, G'rung seems to be acting no differently from usual, so they head off to bed. 

## Day 7 (Tuesday April 19th) - Weather: Foggy with Calm Wind

Damacos joins the party for breakfast. The town is poor and unable to offer monetary payment, but he says that the party can choose from two items of your choice (or on commission) for the whole party from the crafters in town. \[Carpenters, Forge, Blacksmith, Bower, Potter+Glassbower, Tanner\]. Tezarran also informs Damacos that we will indeed be joining their hunting party today. The hunting party is meeting at the church shortly afterwards.
