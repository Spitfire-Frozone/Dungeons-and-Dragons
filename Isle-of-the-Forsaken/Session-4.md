# Isle of the Forsaken - Session 4 - 27/10/21

## Day 6 (Monday April 19th) Part 3 - Weather: Sunny with Moderate Wind.
As the party returns to the village. They hear some quiet talking off to one side, and find another party walking about. Entropy says that given the time this is most likely the other forraging party. 

Nightingale, wanting to investigate themselves, goes through the brush and sees 6 people walking along, carrying sacs of things, and carrying sickles. Satisfied that the party is who Entropy says they were, she rejoins the party. 
~~~
Mormo: If that is the other party, can we walk into town with them? 
~~~
Hearing this the G'rung hails the other party.
~~~
G'rung: Hellooo.
Other party: heloooo?
Tezzaran: Hey, we have Entropy with us, don't worry we're friendly. 
Entropy: Hey it's ok. They are with me. 
~~~
The other party cautiously approaches and relax when they see Entropy is ok. There are 2 humans and 4 tieflings. One of the tieflings, runs over to Mormo, and one of the humans runs over to Robert. Seere runs over to Mormo, who inspects him over, and then goes over to Entroy and barrages here in 

Seeing Entropy overwhelmed with the questions from Seere, Tezzaran informs the new group of the trials of the forest. 
~~~
G'rung: Me G'rung.
Tezzaran: Well met, I'm Tezzaran.
Entropy:

Tezzaran explains to the party the incidents. That they met the runners in the town, got home safe, these were those we found in the forest. 

Oriaanna goes over to console the grieving daughter (Cersei). 
~~~
G'rung: It was a good death. He dies in the best way. He a hunter. 
Tezzaran: It was a good death. He dies in the best way. He a hunter. 
Oriaanna: While not put in the best way, I think my friend was

Seere: Where's Damacos?
Tezzaran: We saw some members of the party before we left for the forest. What does he look like?
Seere: <Explains what Damacos looks like>
Tezzaran: We saw some members of the party be
Baka: Something took off his arm.
~~~

Upon arriving in the village, the party heads to the church. Damacos is sitting on a pew with Jaasmal (his partner).  Chandri and Lukas are still around. Ceidl (Robert's Wife) goes over to Cersei by Robert's body and busts into tears. Oriaanna goes around to Cersei and Ceidl to comfort them. Nightingale slips outside to chill in the graveyard. Entropy and G'rung take the body to the back room (there was a child in there, and they scarpered when the G'rung entered), and Entropy goes to the corner. Baka offers their medical skills to help Damacos and Mormo. Tezzaran makes a splint for Mormo's leg. Bastion is standing guard.

Vezmoba (Lozodon healer) says that Cersei and Ceidl should go to the back room with Robert's body. Oriaanna comforts and guides Cersei and Ceidl there (but they didn't like the way she said it). Cersei and Ceidl enter the room. Cersei cuddles the body of Robert and Ceidl puts her hand on Cersei's shoulder. The room quietend and everyone turns to look at the stranger. G'rung shifts awkwardly but starts to speak. 
~~~
G'rung: Me know now hard it is to lose kin, but he was good man. I know you say he too old, but in my time the wisest hunters keep everyone safe. Without him ... maybe others not make back. Other hunter ... Mormo said he saved them. He would not have survived witout him ... He hero. 
~~~
Ceidl puts a hand on G'rungs shoulder to thank him, but as she touched him she recoils. 
~~~
Ceidl: I would give you a hug, but your skin feels weird. 
G'rung: Is ok. Tezzaran tell me no hug.  
Ceidl: Thank you for your kind words. 
~~~

G'rung leaves the room with Entropy, and Cersei and Ceidl follow them out the door and partially close the door behind them.

Tezzaran goes over asks to Damacos and asks whether we can stay in the nig. The Rivers Bounty . 

Damacos -> to Tezzaran asks about Robert (is he dead.)

Do you know what it was. Was Robert dead when you found him. Hard to spot. We were 9 of us. 

Damacos: Thank you for healing Mormo.

~~~
Tezzaran: The creature to ash. In my experience, creatures do not come back from.
~~~

Damacos asks Tezzaran if they would accompany us on a hunt tomorrow. Jasmaal comes in and admonishes Damacos for this.
~~~
Tezzaran: How pressing is the need for a second hunt. 
Bastion: That was not the main objective of the party. 
Tezzaran: I think we will have to discuss this as a party this evening, preferably over a stiff drink. 
Damacos: We have a riverweed ale
~~~
Damacos lives next to the carpenters Jasmaal's Joinery (The other one is run by Nailed run by (Raandaal and Jasmaal)). He says that he will have an emergency meeting of the town elders to see if they can reward us for killing the monster. In either case, he will swing by the the tomorrow morning with. 

~~~
G'rung: Baka, what is this?
Baka: It is a Constricted cave. It is a place for people to participate in a shared belief. Do you belief in a god or a deity -- a great and poweful deity that controls your future?
G'rung: Yes. My forebare.
Baka: I belief in Koseth, the living flame, and I channel his power into my words
G'rung: You descend from flame? 
Baka: That is where I come from
G'rung: You no look like flame? 
~~~
Baka asks what gods are followed in this place. He is told that there are three major deities worshipped in the town. Meleki of the forest who is worshipped by the foragers and the carpenters; Sylvanas, the god of wild nature whose symbol is an oak leaf \[It was his will that this mound thing accosted us\]; and Domona, the goddess of rivers and healing whose symbol is of a river meandering in the forest. Baka and G'rung go over the alter and share a blessing.

Tezzaran directs the party to the Rivers Bounty and picks up Nightingale outside who was drawing a sketch of the town. Tezzaran gives it a perusal and offers some words of encouragement about the piece as he levels the work against the horizon. Nightingale is a bit hesitant about going to the pub, and raises her hood.
