# Isle of the Forsaken - Session 4 - 27/10/21

## Day 6 (Monday April 19th) Part 3 - Weather: Sunny with Moderate Wind.
As the party returns to the village. They hear some quiet talking off to one side, and find another party walking, not making any real attempt to be stealthy. 
~~~
Nightingale: (!) <The alert noise from metal gear solid>
~~~
Entropy says that given the time this is most likely the other forraging party returning to the village. Nightingale, wanting to investigate themselves, goes through the brush and sees 6 people walking along, carrying sacs of things, and wearing sickles. Satisfied that the party seems to be who Entropy says they were, she rejoins the party. 
~~~
Mormo: If that is the other party, can we walk into town with them? 
~~~
Hearing this the G'rung hails the other party.
~~~
G'rung: Hellooo.
Other party: helloooo?
Tezzaran: Hey, we have Entropy with us, don't worry we're friendly. 
Entropy: Hey it's ok. They are with me. 
~~~
The other party cautiously approaches, sickles out but relax when they see Entropy is ok. There are 2 humans and 4 tieflings. One of the tieflings, Seere, runs over to Mormo, and one of the humans runs over to Robert. Seere, after inspecting Mormo all over, then goes over to Entroy and barrages them with questions and seeking answers.  

Seeing Entropy overwhelmed with the questions from Seere, Tezzaran steps in to inform her, and the rest of the new group of the trials of the forest. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Hi, sorry to bother you, I'm Tezzaran, we joined this party as they went on an expedition to the forest ...
~~~
Tezzaran explains to the party the incidents that befell them since they arrived in the town. That they met the runners of the hunt in the town, that they joined with Entropy at the church and head to the forest to look for the rest, and these were those that were left behind in the forest. Sadly Robert was dead when we found him (Cersei cries some more), but as he was patched up, Mormo should be fine if we get him to the village. 

After this explanation, Oriaanna goes over to console the grieving daughter (Cersei). 
~~~
G'rung: It was good death. He died in the best way. He a hunter. 
Tezzaran: Shh G'rung, probably not the best way.
G'rung: NO! Tez'ran. He a hero. I am hon'ring this man.
Tezzaran: I agree ... but the time for honouring this mans death G'rung is not now.

Oriaanna: While not put in the best way, I think my friend was trying 
Cersei: *cheers up a little bit*
~~~

~~~
Seere: Where's Damacos?
Tezzaran: Who is Damacos? What does he look like?
Seere: <Explains what Damacos looks like>
Tezzaran: Apologies. We saw some members of the party before we left for the forest. Though the last time I saw him, he was definately shy of an arm. 
Seere: What?
Baka: Something removed his arm.
~~~

### Arrival in the Village

Upon arriving in the village, the party heads to the church. Damacos is sitting on a pew with Jaasmal (his partner).  Chandri and Lukas are still around. Ceidl (Robert's Wife) goes over to Cersei by Robert's body and busts into tears. Oriaanna goes around to Cersei and Ceidl to comfort them. Nightingale slips outside to chill in the graveyard. Entropy and G'rung take the body to the back room (there was a child in there, and they scarpered when the G'rung entered), and Entropy goes to the corner. G'rung holds their head down near the body. Baka offers their medical skills to help Damacos and Mormo. Tezzaran makes a splint for Mormo's leg. Bastion is standing guard by the entrance.

Vezmoba (Lozodon healer) says that Cersei and Ceidl should go to the back room with Robert's body. Oriaanna comforts and eventually guides Cersei and Ceidl there (but they didn't appreciate the way Oriaanna said it). Cersei and Ceidl enter the room. Cersei cuddles the body of Robert and Ceidl puts her hand on Cersei's shoulder. The room quietens and everyone turns to look at the stranger. G'rung shifts awkwardly but starts to speak. 
~~~
G'rung: Me know now hard it is to lose kin, but he was good man. I know you say he too old, but in my time the wisest hunters keep everyone safe. Without him ... maybe others not make back. Other hunter ... the one with the broken leg [Entropy: Mormo] Mormo ... said he saved them. He would not have survived witout him ... He hero. 
~~~
Ceidl puts a hand on G'rungs shoulder to thank him, but as she touched him she recoils. 
~~~
Ceidl: I would give you a hug, but your skin feels weird. 
G'rung: Is ok. Tez'ran tell me no hug.  
Ceidl: Thank you for your kind words. 
~~~

G'rung leaves the room with Entropy, and Cersei and Ceidl follow them out the door and partially close the door behind them.

Tezzaran goes over asks to Damacos and Chandri to ask where our party can stay in the night. We are directed to The Rivers Bounty by Damacos, but as we start giving directions, Chandri interrupts and says that was where they met our party.

Damacos then starts to ask to Tezzaran asks about the events of the day. 


Robert (is he dead.)

Do you know what it was. Was Robert dead when you found him. Hard to spot. We were 9 of us. 

Damacos: Thank you for healing Mormo.

~~~
Damacos: Is the creature dead?
Tezzaran: The creature to ash. In my experience, creatures do not come back from.
~~~

Damacos asks Tezzaran if they would accompany us on a hunt tomorrow. Jasmaal comes in and admonishes Damacos for this.
~~~
Tezzaran: How pressing is the need for a second hunt. 
Bastion: That was not the main objective of the party when we arrived. 
Tezzaran: I think we will have to discuss this as a party this evening, preferably over a stiff drink. 
Bastion: I would like to see this stiff drink.
Damacos: We have a riverweed ale
Tezzaran: I cannot commit us to cause
Damacos: I understand
~~~
Damacos lives next to the carpenters Jasmaal's Joinery (The other one is run by Nailed It run by Raandaal and Jasmaal). He says that he will have an emergency meeting of the town elders to see if they can reward us for killing the monster. In either case, he will swing by the the tomorrow morning with their decision and to hear the party's decision on whether to accompany tomorrows hunt. 

~~~
G'rung: Baka, what is this? *points all around him*
Baka: It is a constructed cave. It is a place for people to participate in a shared belief. Do you belief in a god or a deity -- a great and poweful deity that controls your future?
G'rung: ... Yes. My forebears.
Baka: I belief in Koseth, the living flame, and I channel his power into my words.
G'rung: You descend from flame? 
Baka: That is where I come from.
G'rung: You no look like flame.
~~~

Baka asks what gods are followed in this place. He is told that there are three major deities worshipped in the town. Meleki of the forest who is worshipped by the foragers and the carpenters; Sylvanas, the god of wild nature whose symbol is an oak leaf \[It was his will that this mound thing accosted us\]; and Domona, the goddess of rivers and healing whose symbol is of a river meandering in the forest. Baka and G'rung go over the alter and share a blessing. These latter two deities are worshipped by everyone in the town. 

Baka takes the G'rung over to the altar and offers a blessing to the local deities and Koseth. Baka uses simple language to get G'rung to understand, and G'rung nods silently along. 


Upon seeing more and more people leave the church, and that things are startgin to wind down, Tezzaran directs the party to go the Rivers Bounty and picks up Nightingale who is outside who was drawing a sketch of the town. Tezzaran gives it a perusal and offers some words of encouragement about the piece as he holds up the work against the horizon.

~~~
Tezzaran: We're going to the Rivers Bounty
Nightingale: <General hubbub of noises you'd find in a crowded place> *tilts head to the side questioningly*
Tezzaran: Yes, but I don't know whether the place is going to be busy.
Nightingale: *raises hood and shrinks a bit*
~~~

### The Rivers Bounty

In the Rivers Bounty, the place is ratehr busy. There is a very noticeable white-skinned red-haired tiefling is running around (Barakas) behind the bar. The place looks too busy for just one person to be running things. The party makes their way over to the bar, and Nightingale goes off to the quietest place she can find, a small table with one seat. Bastion follows her and stands beside the table. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Hello!
Barakas: Very busy. I need to serve him, him, them and then them, and then i'll get to you. 
Tezzaran: That's fine. I'm happy to wait.
~~~
Tezzaran offers to buy a round of drinks for everyone, and asks people what they want. 
~~~
Baka: I'll have a wine please, but can you make it warm? 
Oriaanna: A wine for me as well please.
Tezaran: I think i'll try that ale that Damacos recommended. 
Tezaran: What about Nightingale and Bastion?
Oriaanna: *Goes over to the where Nightingale and Bastion are* Would you like a drink. 
Bastion: I would like the stiff drink please.
Nightingale: seeeing everyone else in the place has at least one galss in front of them *nods head*
Oriaanna: What would you like, ale?
Nightingale: *shrugs indifferently*
Oriaanna: Wine?
Nightingale: *shrugs indifferently*
Oriaanna: Liquor?
Nightingale: *completely lost*
Passing bartender: I think you'll find it's either ale or water Where do you think we grow the grapes to make wine?
Oriaanna: *walks back to the bar* They only do ale or water here. 
Tezzaran: 6 Riverweed ales it is! Oriaanna, you don't look so pleased about this.
Oriaanna: It's fine i'll have a beer. 
Tezzaran: Is this fine with you Baka?
Baka: As long as it's warm.
~~~
Baka and Oriaanna go over to where Nightingale and Bastion are and pull a nearby table over and draw chair for everyone. While G'rung joins Tezarran at the bar.
~~~
G'rung: Tez'ran what is buy?
Tezzaran: Looks down at the Grung <a sigh of wonder> ...
Tezzaran: Say you have some moss, and someone else has sticks. You want their moss, and they want your sticks. Yes?
G'rung: Yes?
Tezzaran: You would swap your moss for their sticks, yes
G'rung: Me like swapping moss for sticks. 
Tezzaran: Ok, if you don't have any moss, but want the sticks, you can still swap with something else yes? 
G'rung: Yees?
Tezzaran: Like for example ... these *shows a copper, silver and gold coin* If you swap with coin its called buying.
G'rung: Oki
Tezzaran: Not everywhere has sticks but most people carry these coins. Do you have some of these on you?
G'rung: Yes. Can I buy?
Tezzaran: Sure! *pulls up a stool and points to up*
G'rung: *hops on the stool, and seeing the bar for the first time* oooh!
Tezzaran: So we are ordering these drinks.
~~~
The bartender has now finished serving everyone and heads over to Tezzaran 
~~~
Barakas: Apologies for the wait. Other bar staff had a loss in the family, so I'm here all alone. What can I get you.  
Tezzaran: 6 Riverweed ales please! Is it possilbe to warm one of those up? Or are they served at a particular temperature?
Barakas: All our ales are served at room temperature. I guess I can put it on the stove? How hot do you want it. 
Tezzaran: Yeah sure that will be fine, just under boiling is fine.  
Barakas: That will be two silver please. 
Tezzaran: *nods to G'rung*
G'rung: Here *about to hand over two gold pieces*
Tezzaran: Wait!
Barakas: <sighs, shrugs shoulders> *starts pouring drinks* 
Tezzaran: Do you have any of these *hold up a silver piece*
G'rung: *searches his pockets* No
Tezzaran: Ah, it just that this gold piece can be swapped for many of these silver pieces, and our friend here is asking for two of these *the pieces he is holding in his hands* not two of those *points to the gold piece the Grung is holding*
Tezzaran: I'll get these then *hands over two silver pieces*
~~~
While returning from the bar, Tezzaran spies Astar making eyes at Entropy who is sat drinking at a different table.
~~~ 
Tezzaran: Honestly, just go talk to them.
Astars: *shifts awkwardly and stares intently into his drink*
~~~

~~~
Bastion: *upends drink* That wasn't very stiff. 
Tezzaran: (ahh, note to self). I think the stiffness meant that the drink has alcohol in it, as opposed to the property of the liquid itself. 
Bastion: Understood. Perhaps we should freeze it next time, as an experiment.
~~~

Grung quickly finished his drink, Tezzaran exchanges one of the grungs gold pieces for ten of his silver pieces. One of those will be enough for you to buy another and the g'rung goes off to buy another drink. 

~~~
hops on bar
hey get down from there, I assume that you want another drink?
Grung hops ontp the floor yes
hands a drink down to the grung, offers out hand,
G'rung: hands a silver piece over
: wait your change
G'rung: *looks confused as he receives 6 copper pieces* oki
~~~

Tezarran teaches, cheering to the G'ung but Grung is too vigourous. and smashed his glass, and shards of glass embedd the frogs skin. Tezzaran puts on his gloves and helps take the shards out, but 

A man comes over to clean the glass and say he will get it reblown. 


The party has a discussion about what their long terms goals are. 
~~~
G'rung: Wants to find out who took us and why? Find them, we talk them and kill them.
Bastion: I require a large library. for a pupose larger than this
Oriaanna: Was interested in visitng this part of the world. She works for troubled individuals in her city, currently on an ambassadorial role. 
Baka: Here to protect my friend Oriaanna, who is here on a work trip. 

Tezzaran: Interested in adventure, but that question about why were specifically were chosen irks me. Gets out the map. In the short terms I would like to decipher this and orient myself. 

Nightingale: *stabs the map in a particular spot* 


Tezzaran: there's a library in Malacham ... but it's not open acess. Lets put it this way I've never been inside.
Oriaanna: Dimadorf has a library.
~~~
The party gets food from the bar. 
Nightingale peels off and goes fishing in the river.
