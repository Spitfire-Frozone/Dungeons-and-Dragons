# Isle of the Forsaken - Session 1 - 25/09/21
 

## Day 2 (April 15th) - Weather: Snowy
After a long rest Tezzaran has gained some new skills and he touches Bastion to bestow him with a temporary (+1 AC) boost in agility. He also created the Hewards Handy Haversack. Baka also bestows a blessing on G'rung's weapon. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Bastion. I have newfound abilities that may assist you in not getting hit in. May I touch you to see if this works?
~~~

The party decides to try and go west. Tezzaran offers to use the hastily drawn map to trace their steps, making notes of notable landmarks in our travel direction. Nightingale silently heads towards the front of the party and offers to scout. G'rung and Oriaanna jointly take the job of navigating the party towards its destination. 

At the end of the day, we have travelled some way towards our direction but Tezzarans thinks we have gone wrong a bit because we aren't out of the mountains yet. 

During the night, a powered-down Bastion heard a branch snapping and very deep owl hoot nearby. Three owlbears appear to be approaching the party from the south west. 

Nightingale attempts to mimic the sounds of us fighting in the caves to the west of us in an attempt to scare away the owlbears. This partially succeeds but all the other members of the party save Tezzaran also fall for this ploy. Nightingale lights a stick in the campfire and runs away. Bastion takes a heavy hit from the shadows as an owlbear lunges for him. Oriaanna seeing this launches a firebolt at said attacking owlbear. 

Bastion attacks the owlbear that lashed out at him but the blow only glances the hide. Nightingale tries the sound ventroliquism again. G'rung awakes to the owlbears attacks and signals for everyone to retreat, having recognised the threat as being similar to one he encountered in the Feywild. He takes a step forward towards Bastion. Tezzaran fires a firebolt at the owlbear that attacks Bastion. He picks up a stick on the ground to use a makeshift torch by using the campfire embers to light it. This is to light the retreat for the party. Baka straps the grucket to himself and retreats towards Tezzaran. Oriaanna fires another firebolt at the owlbear. 

Bastion retreats from the attacking owlbears and slowly the party is able to conduct a fighting retreat. G'rung takes a mighty swing at the owlbear that came after Bastion and uses the momentum of the swing to launch himself backwards towards Tezzaran, but unfortunately gets hit in response by the owlbear mid-bounce.

The sounds of confused and scared owlbears moving away from the party is heard while the party moves in the other direction. Baka heals Bastion, but one of the owlbears decided to doggedly persue its meal and comes unnassisted toward the party. 

Oriaanna weakly shocking grasp Nightingale fires an arrow into it's eye and it lets out a piercing roar. G'rung flings itself into the air and uses the momentum to bring down the warhammer on the head of the owlbear smashing it into the ground, killing it.

~~~
G'rung: waaaaaaaargh!
~~~

After the battle Tezzaran suggests that the meat could be used for rations. Baka and Nightingale agree that a corpse is best not left unattended in the night. Tezzaran is helped by G'rung and Nightingale to cut up owlbear into pieces. He puts 25lbs of this owlbear flesh into the Hewards Handy Haversack (being careful not to take too much as to burst the bag).  

As we are on the move to another location, we encounter some wild pigs; and at a small distance from the pigs finish our nights rest. 

## Day 3 (April 16th) - Weather: Overcast

We crest over a hill as we enter the grasslands and we come upon eight 9ft tall chicken-looking things with beaks in the shapes of axeheads (Axebeaks). Nightingale dips into the bush and signals her warning whistle. She again tries some voice ventriloquism by mimicking an owlbear noise in the North. The axebeaks dart off in a southerly direction in a very fast speed.

Low hills and grasslands lie in front of us. North west about half a days travel, is the south eastern edge of a forest. Half a day to the east, back the way we came are mountains. South for a days travels are more mountains. We need to be going in a southwesterly direction. 

~~~
Tezaran: I wanted to go in the direction that meant we had the highest chance of encountering a town so we can gather out bearings. 
Baka: Shouldn't we then be travelling east. 
Tezzaran: Wait. Oh? Ah fuck. We're travelling WEST? I meant East. 
Tezzaran: I'm so sorry guys. I had a brain fart.
G'rung: Do no worry It oK Tezzaran
Oriaanna: It's perfectly ok Tezzaran. I know where we are. It was meant to be. 
~~~

Since Baka is a vegetarian, Nightingale eats meat raw and Bastion doesn't eat, Tezzaran cooks the owlbear meat to perfection for himself G'rung and Oriaanna. 

## Day 4 (April 17th) - Weather: Sunny with Moderate Wind.

After an uneventful days travel. Nightingale spots chimney smoke in a south-southwesterly direction.

~~~
Nightingale: *Jumps up and down excitedly*
Nightingale: << Hubbub of town noise >>
Nightingale: << "4 Copper coins for a pound of fresh fish" >>
G'rung: What did birb see
Baka: Nightingale has seen the signs of a town or settlement ahead.
~~~

In the absence of any pools of water around. G'rung will have to use the Grucket to stay hydrated overnight. However it being days since the water was changed, it is a bit stale so Tezzaran uses Create or Destroy Water to refresh the water in the Grucket for the G'rung, before he heads to bed.

~~~
G'rung: Why you speak so much?
Nightingale: *Looks sad and sighs*
G'rung: Oh no, you sad.... You wanna hug.
Nightingale: *backs away*
Tezzaran: G'rung, it was nice of you to offer a hug but what did I say about giving out hugs.
G'rung: *Looks sad and sighs, but sits next to Nightingale*
Tezzaran: *walks over to the pair and offers both some salted meat* It's ok. Why not eat our troubles away. 
~~~

## Day 5 (April 18th) - Weather: Showers of Rain with Calm Winds.

After an uneventful morning of travel. In the afternoon Nightingale while scouting ahead hears a huffing noise and motions for us to get down. While trying to investigate futher, her foot gets stuck in a mud pool and she falls face-first into a branch snapping it and drawing the attention of three wild rhinos, which stare at her. Nightingale dusts herself off and goes back to the party, who decide to avoid any possible confrontation by taking a small diversion. 

At the end of the day, the town is three quarters of a days travel away. If we set off in the morning, we would get there in the late afternoon after the shops have closed, but not the taverns! This prompts the discussion to turn to pub and alcohol (as Tezzaran has to explain the concept of alcohol and towns to G'rung) but at the mention of pubs/taverns Nightingale looked very unconfortable. 

A river is seen by the party to the south. It is the River Aur. The last of the owlbear meat is finished.

## Day 6 (April 19th) - Weather: Sunny with Moderate Wind.

Before the party sets off, Tezzaran buries the now off meat just outside of camp. The town is in sight! In the morning we encounter a cuboidal metal deivce with two metal cups on one end. Nightingale waves us forward. She rights the box, adds some water to both the cups. This causes the object to spark and Nightingale, squarks,  flaps her wings and retreats.

~~~
G'rung:Is this pub?
Tezzaran and Oriaanna: No! Get away!
G'rung: But this pub though
Tezzaran: No big boom!
G'rung: *BOING*

* Party waits for a boom in shocked silence *

G'rung: It no boom
Tezzaran: Perhaps not. 
~~~
Tezzaran and G'rung go over to try and stop the sparking

Tezzaran wants to get rid of the water by knocking it over and before anyone can do anything G'rung picks it up and gets a nasty shock, but does manage to knock most of the water out by knocking it on it's side. Its still sparking a bit. 

~~~
Tezzaran: Hmm. Square. Stores lighting energy. Sparks in contact with water. I think its Power Generation Unit. or PUG. I've never seen one before but it's very strange how it's just in the road like this.  
~~~

In the afternoon, the ground starts shaking underfoot, and the party get knocked over save for Bastion and G'rung, but after this we decide to head to the town.
