## Day 2 (April 15th)
After a long rest Tezzaran has gained some new skills and touches Bastion and bestows him with a temporary (+1 AC) boost in speed. He also created the Hewards Handy Haversack. Baka also bestows a blessing on Grung's weapon.

Tezzaran: Bastion. I have found that I can a .May I touch you?

## Travel
The party decides to try and go west. Tezzaran offers to use the hastily drawn map to trace our steps, making notes of notable landmarks in a particular direction. Nightingale silently heads towards the front of the party and offers to scout. Grung and Oriaanna take towards Navigating the party towards its destination. 

At the end of the day, we have travelled a way but Tezzarans thinks we have gone wrong a bit because we aren't out of the mountains yet. 

During the night, a powered-down Bastion heard a branch snapping and very deep owl hoot nearby. Three owlbears appear to be approaching the party from the south west. 

Nightingale attempts to mimic the sounds of us fighting in the caves to the west of us in an attempt to scare away the owlbears. This partially suceeds but all the other members of the party save Tezzaran also fall for this ploy. Bastion takes a heavy hit from the shadows as an owlbear lunges for him. Oriaanna seeing this launches a firebolt at said attacking owlbear. 

Bastion attacks the owlbear that lashed out at him but the blow only glances the hide. Nightingale tries the sound ventroliquism again. Grung awakes to the owlbears attacks and signals for everyone to retreat, taking a step forward towards Bastion. Tezzaran fires a firebolt at the owlbear that attacks Tezzaran and uses a stick on the ground as a makeshift torch to aid in his retreat. Baka straps the grucket to himself and retreats towards Tezzaran. Oriaanna fires another firebolt at the owlbear. 

Bastion retreats from the attacking owlbears and slowly the party is able to conduct a fighting retreat. Grung takes a mighty swing at the owlbear that came after Bastion and uses the momentum of the swing to launch himself backwards towards Tezzaran, but unfortunately gets hits mid-bounce.

The sounds of confused and scared owlbears moving away from the party is heard while the party moves in the other direction. Baka heals Bastion, but one of the owlbears decided to doggedly persue it's meal and comes unnassisted toward the party. 

Oriaanna weakly shopping Nightingale fires an arrow into it's eye and it lets out a piercing roar. Grung 

The Grung Flings itself into the air and uses the momentum to bring down the warhammer on the head of the owlbear smashing it into the ground

Grung: waaaaaaaargh!

Tezzaran suggests that the meat could be used for rations. Baka and Nightingale agree that a corpse is best not left unattended. Tezzaran is helped by Grung and Nightingale to cut up owlbear into pieces. He puts 25lbs of this owlbear flesh into the Hewards Handy Haversack (being careful not to take too much as to ).  

As we are on the move to another location we encounter some wild pigs, and at a small distance from the pigs finish our nights rest.
