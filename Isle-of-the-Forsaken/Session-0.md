We awake in a vision of the past. We are now. Paelias, Vani (me), Sora, Vola-shumo, Orla, Baern. We are opposite a table from a Vistra Hardheart who says that we need to buy time for the mages to prepare banishment spells to banish the dragons. 

Now that we think about it, we know our new compansions, and we have always known them. We have some influence about how this dream goes. We ready ourselved for battle against Tiamat. Our horses have been prepared and we ride for battle.

We ride out through the city and Vistra Hardheart greets us,

Vast armies are facing dragons in open fields. There are far too many dragons for us to possibly win. Thunder rocks our bodies as we see the largest dragon we have ever seen, towering over even the ancient dragons. It is a 5 headed dragon of Black, Blue, Green, Red, White. It is accompanied by three smaller dragons.  

~~~
Paelias: If we survive this, the first rounds on me!

Vani: I'll hold you to that.

The dragons are riding past us and we try to get their attention. Sora cunjours up a storm with a northern wind to try and impede the dragons. Paelius and Vani petition Tiamat to face us in battle rather than go for the city. Orla-Nim manages to get Tiamat's attention by casting crown of stars into her side, and Tiamat heads for the fortress where the attack came from and starts slashing at her.
