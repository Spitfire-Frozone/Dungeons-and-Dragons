<our vision fades>
We awake. 

Paelias, Vani (me), Sora, Vola-shumo, Orla, Baern 
Vistra Hardheart 

Now that we think about it, we know our new compansions, and we have always known them. We have some influence about how this dream goes. We ready ourselved for battle against Tiamat. Our horses have been prepared and we ride for battle. 
<our vision fades>
We ride out through the city and Vistra Hardheart greets us, 
<our vision fades>
Vast armies are facing dragons in open fields. There are far too many dragons for us to possibly win. Thunder rocks our bodies as we see the largest dragon we have ever seen, towering over even the ancient dragons. It is a 5 headed dragon of Black, Blue, Green, Red, White. It is accompanied by three smaller dragons.  

Paelias: If we survive this, the first rounds on me!
Vani: I'll hold you to that. 

The dragons are riding past us and we try to get their attention. Sora cunjours up a storm with a northern wind to try and impede the dragons.
