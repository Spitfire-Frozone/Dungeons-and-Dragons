## Past Vision
We awake in a vision of the past. We are now. Paelias, Vani (me), Sora, Vola-shumo, Orla, Baern. We are opposite a table from a Vistra Hardheart who says that we need to buy time for the mages to prepare banishment spells to banish the dragons. 

Now that we think about it, we know our new compansions, and we have always known them. We have some influence about how this dream goes. We ready ourselved for battle against Tiamat. Our horses have been prepared and we ride for battle. 

*vision fades*

We ride out through the city and Vistra Hardheart greets us by the gate, 
~~~
Vistra: If you manage to stop the dragon and save our civilisation, it will owe you a great debt.
~~~
*vision fades*

Vast armies are facing dragons in open fields. There are far too many dragons for us to possibly win. Thunder rocks our bodies as we see the largest dragon we have ever seen, towering over even the ancient dragons. It is a 5 headed dragon of Black, Blue, Green, Red, White. It is accompanied by three smaller dragons; a red one a white one and a green one.  

~~~
Paelias: If we survive this, the first rounds on me!

Vani: I'll hold you to that. 
~~~
The dragons are riding past us and we try to get their attention. Vola-Shump conjours up a storm with a northern wind to try and impede the dragons. Paelius and Vani petition Tiamat to face us in battle rather than go for the city. Orla-Nim opens up a portal to a nearly fortress and she and Baern jump in it. Vani heads straight for Tiamat and tries to fire an arrow but it misses. Orla-Nim She then manages to get Tiamat's attention by casting crown of stars into her side, and Tiamat heads for the fortress where the attack came from and claps her good. The portal dissapears.

Orla-Nim is healed by Baern and then Tiamat then breaths cold on the tower freezing and killing the horses. Meanwhile the white dragon lands and Paelius engages it in combat slashing it with her swords and conjours a magic weapon to attack it as well. Seeing her teammate in battle, Vani then rides to the back of the dragon leaps of her horse, clambers up the back of the White dragon, and slices through it's neck, killing the white dragon. The Green Dragon then lands and poison breaths us. Vola-shump attacks the Green and Red dragons with a Prismatic Ray. Orla-Nim then Dimension Doors with Baern out of combat with Tiamat to behind the red dragon to attack it with a Crown of Stars. Tiamat then comes to party and hevers 5ft above the ground above Paelias and Vani. The Red Dragon then in response breaths fire on Orla-Nim and Baern, and Baern falls unconscious. Tiamat then breaths a massive cone of poisons hitting the green and red dragons, Vani, Paelias and Sora.

Paelias leaps onto Tiamat and attempts to mount her using her swords to stab the hide and climb Tiamat. Vani attempts to follow suit. She slashes the Green Dragon to get away and leaps for Tiamat, but her attack misses, Vani recovers and uses her Second-Story Work feature to start climbing Tiamat.   
~~~
Vani (to Paelias): By any means necessary 
~~~
Sora then runs to the Green Dragon and recklessly attacks it, it misses a retaliatory bite. Vola-Shump atttemps to Disintigrate Tiamat. She looks unaffected. Vola-Shump is disheartened but inspires Paelias halfway up the dragon. 
~~~
Vola-Shump (to Paelias): Good Work! Keep Going
~~~
Orla-Nim attemps to Disintigrate the Red dragon, but that similarly fails. The Crown of Stars effects attacks the dragons and in then repsone the Red Dragon claws her. Tiamat rips into Vola-Shump dealing a nice amount of damage. Paelias manages to climb up Tiamats back while stabbing her with her swords. Vani attempts to follow suit and climbs up Tiamat leg onto her back and stabs her sneakily. Sora recklessly attacks the Green Dragon again and smashes it to a pulp. Vola-Shump uses Tesers Transformation and engages Tiamat in melee combat. 

Orla-Nim pour a potion down Baerns throat, and makes Crown of Stars deal more damage to the Red Dragon. She steps away while shielding herself from the attack of opportunity. Tiamat soars into the sky and attempts to shake off Paelias and Vani, but this fails. She lands in the same place and attacks Vola-Shump. She attempts to whip at Paelias with her tail, but misses. The Red Dragon misses Baern who heals himself and attempts to bonk it with a spiritual weapon. Paelias and Vani attacks Tiamat's black head and it breaths vomits acid on us. Sora runs over to Tiamat and leaps on the base of her tail and smashed her. Tiamat raises her red head and washes her back with fire. Vani slides under a different head of dragon evading damage, but Paelias and Sora aren't so lucky, they fail to evade the attack. Paelias falls unconscious, falling off the dragon and plunging to the earth and Sora retaliates by dealing a brutal critical bash with her warhammer. 

~~~
Vola-Shump: Nooo!
~~~
Seeing Paelius falling off the dragon, Vola-Shump brings out their harp, plays a fiddly tune and flies up to land on Tiamat's back. They savagely swipe at Tiamat, critically savage attacking her. Orla-Nim makes Crown of Stars deal more damage to the Red Dragon before polymorphing into a Giant Ape and pulls Baern out of combat on her back. Tiamat flies up into the sky and once again tries to shake the assailants on her back. Vani gets flung off the dragon into the forest but she manages to use the tree branches to break some of her fall. Vola-Shump and Sola manage to cling on but Tiamat, lands next to the Great Ape and attacks it. Baern summons Spirit Guardians to attack the surrounding dragons makes his spirit weapon pierce Tiamat. 


At this point, all of Tiamats heads turn to look at a mountain in the distance. A bright light appears from the mountain and Tiamat shrieks. We bought enough time for the Wizards! As Vani breaths a side of relief. An massive explosion rocks the mountain destorying capital city and a shockwave echoes throughout the surrounding lands. We fade into dust. Vola-Shump and Sola dissapears with Tiamat and wake up in Hell.

## Day 1 

We awake underground in a dungeon, the ceiling is made of rock. Ancient scratches of pickaxes are still visible. There are corridoors in three directions with tracks that line the room and go down these corridors. In the centre there is a rotating platform to allow trolleys to change tracks. These tracks are old. 

A lattice of bars seperate us from the rest of the room and in it is a forbidding padlocked door. Outside of the cell there is a wooden chest to the side with all equipment in it. Nightingale recall thats we were handled by two groups of people. 

Nightingale was able to stealthily keep a lock picking device upon being captured and Tezzaran helps Nightingale open the lock. The chest is then opened. Faint sound of rushing water can be heard from the North. We don our gear and head in the direction of the running water. The G'rung looks very exhausted and requires a water bath. 

We follow the sound of water to a room with a waterfall and the G'rung decides to jump into the water. G'rung is beset by a swarm of Quippers, and shrieks for help and the party attacks the Quippers. Oriaanna readys a shocking grasp for when the water is cleared. 
~~~
Oriaanna: G'rung get out of the water!
~~~
Tezzaran rushes up the waters edge and throws a rope over the side of the lake to allow the G'rung to climb up and escape. 
~~~
Tezzaran: G'rung, use this to climb up!
~~~
The G'rung dissappears under the water and makes a mighty leap off the floor holding it's hammer in the air and brings it down on the fish. Nightingale stabs the fish again, and Oriaanna attempts the same maneouvre.
~~~
Oriaanna (more sternly): G'rung. Get. Out. Of. The. Water!
~~~

Tezzaran seeing that the G'rung is more than capeable of getting out fires a firebolt at the remaing fish in the school and kills them. Tezzaran and Nightingale then use the rope to help Bastion out of the water. 

Nightingale spots a twinking thing in the the mouth of the river. She dives in the water and finds bags of money, and sees they are coming from the dead skeleton of a dwarf, around its neck is a silver pendant with a picture of a smiling dwarf woman which Nightingale puts arounds her neck.

Tezzaran asks Nightingale what she saw under the water and realises that the bird that has been with us does not have a name.
~~~
Tezzaran: What is your name? 
Nightingale: ??? 
Tezzaran: Do you have a name?
Nightingale: *shakes head* 
Baka: Would you like us to give you a name?
Nightingale: *nods head* 
Baka: Why don't you give us a noise. 
Nightingale: *makes bird noises* 
Baka: That .. sounds the common Nightingale
Nightingale: Nightingale?
Baka: You like that yes?
Nightingale: Yes
Tezzaran: So you would like be called to be Nightingale then 
Nightingale: Nightingale then
~~~

The rest of the party introduces themselves to each other [Baka, Bastion, G'rung, Nightingale, Tezzaran and Oriaanna]
while the G'rung rehydrates and recalls the collective dream that they that past night and that they each inhabited the mind of another character. 

The party then heads back south back to the prison room. Nightingale hears a hiss of snakes up to the west ahead and slinks off to investigate alone, she returns and G'rung and her head sound, but hastily retreat when they hear the sound of crushing flesh. The head back North and in another x-junction, see some black smoke to the North, which Baka and Tezzaran investigate, it seems to come through from the other side and is unnatural, and . Nightingale motions towards Tezzaran and the party realises that Nightingale saw a Vedalken with the same smoke coming from their eyes.

G'rung and Bastion head on down the corridor and discover the room that Nightingale saw. Bastion making no attempt to hide his presence and they are spotted, so the party rushes into combat. 

G'rung rages and dashes into the room and attacks a bandit. Tezzaran and Oriaanna hold firebolts for when the assailants attack, and after one swings and misses G'rung, they release them through a narrow opening and the bandit meets a fiery doom. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Nice shooting Oriaanna!
~~~
Bastion and Nightingale dent a second bandit, Baka enters the room and one-shots the third with a guiding bolt. Oriaanna finishes off the last one with another firebolt. We enter the kitchen and G'rung spots another group of 5 bandits and bursts down the corridor after them still raging but misses its initial attack. 
~~~
Oriaanna: Why do we let the G'rung lead!
~~~
Nightingale hits one with an arrow and Tezzaran hurls a warbling mass of chaotic energy that nearest bandit and kills it. G'rung now free of the bandit in front of it decapitates one hiding in a crevice next to it, but fellow bandits go after it. Baka kills ones with a sacred flame, and another slashed Nightingale. Bastion pops up out of a corridor blocks the corridor taking off the non-sword arm of the nearest bandit, and the party take pot shots at the kettled bandits until they die.
