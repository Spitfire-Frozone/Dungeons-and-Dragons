# Isle of the Forsaken - Session 3 - 29/09/21
 

## Day 6 (April 19th) Part 2 - Weather: Sunny with Moderate Wind.

The party sets foot within the gates. Ahead of us is an inn called the Rivers Bounty. They see a young Human woman: Ginger hair, athletic build 5'11ft, grey eyes, brown skin. Running towards the inn, hops the fence and dashes in the front door. From behind the inn another person (olive skin and black hair) hops the fence to a building to the west. 

After a minute, a scream is heard from the tavern and the ginger woman bursts out and is accompanied by a blond haired very skinny woman who hops the fence and runs in a southernly direction. 

~~~
Tezzaran: Do you need help?
~~~

The blonde one continues on ignores this call, but the ginger woman stops, looking confused she she slowly makes her way towards the party. From the house to the west the person that just run in person joined by a pink-skinned blue-haired Karen Aasimar, and they run in the direction of the blonde woman.  

~~~
Ginger Woman: Do you konw what you might be able to help?
Tezzaran: We're here we might as well. 
Orianna: Stop! We can help you, but can you give us more information
Ginger Woman: There's injured people in the church, help!
~~~

The party follows the running woman to the church to the south of the village. 
~~~
Nightingale: *mimmicks police siren*
~~~

At the church the blonde woman is in a heated discussion with a Tiefling man (black skin, white eyes and longer-than-shoulder length black hair) whose lower part of left arm is missing (looks like it's torn off) and bleeding out on the floor. 

~~~
G'rung: Need help with kill?
~~~

At this remark, everyone in the church is looking at the frog. 

~~~
Tezzaran: What my friend means is how can we be of service?
Aasimar woman: My daughters partner is still out there. Something has come over the forest recently and tt caught the hunters unawares. We need someone to go out nad see what happens?
Tezzaran: *breaths out* What is your name, who are we looking for and how many of you returned. 
Jazmal: My name is Jazmal. 2 people are missing Robert (Cersei's father) and (Seers parner) Mormo are missing. 2 are injured. The 2 runners returned unharmed. 
Tezzaran: What's the quickest way to get to where they came from. 

Baka: Take me to the wounded
~~~

Baka goes over to the wounded and helps out, but the loxodons are doing a better job. 

Three more people enter the fray. The leader (black hair red eyes, purle skin. Short horns that curl up a little.) kicks open the church door. They are wearing studded leather armour. The second is a young pink tiefling that stares at the leader in awe, and the third is a white skin sliver eyed tiefling. The start shouting for an update   

They see us and head over. 

~~~
Entropy: Who are you?
Tezzaran: We are passing strangers. Looking to help out in any way we can 
Entropy: Good, more backup
Baka: Now is not the time for many words
G'rung: We need help. Let's go now.
~~~

Jazmal rattles off a list of local landmarks to Entropy who heads off in that direction.
~~~
Tezzran: *jogging after the leader* Excuse me, we'll join you, but what if your name
Entropy: Entropy
Astar: I'm Astar and he's Chairon. 
~~~

On the way to the forest. Entropy explains that she is training to be an adventurer like us. The town has an elder system, made up of the most senior of each of the professions. The forest we are going starts of semi-lush but quickly turns into one where the trees have gnarles leaves and what would be underbush is more spiiked vines and dead plants. It's conspiciously absent of any bird noise. This happened about a month ago after a thunderstorm and this darkness is spreading towards the town. They do not know what the creature looks like. 

Looking around. Tezzaran finds an absence of any creature tracks at all. 

~~~
Tezzaran: How will find this creature.
G'rung: Me know hunt. There will be scream.
Tezzaran: I think I agree with you G'rung. I don't see a single creature track. I think the creature will find us first rather than us finding it.
G'rung: Me told you. 
~~~

Nightingale jumps back as she spots a mummifies hand underneath her foot. The party looks at it and Tezzaran pokes it with a stick. It just seems to be a severed mummified hand. 

~~~
Baka: I don't think this hand belongs to any of the people we are looking for. I think we should move on.
Tezzaran: I agree. *kicks the hand into the bushes.* Lets not let that spook someone else.
Bastion: I think we should journey to the site where 
Entropy: I agree
~~~

Baka and G'rung spot a mangle leg in a tree, and see someone in the tree, staring at the ground and cowering in fear of the nearby forest, but we see nothing. 

~~~
Baka: *shouting to person in tree* Should we not be on the ground. 
Tree dweller: It's here, it's just very still. If I take my eyes off it, I will lose it.
~~~

The party inches closer, preparing to attack. While looking for the creature, Tezzaran is spooked by something and fires a firebolt at the ground in front of G'rung, who leaps forward. 

~~~
Tezzaran: Sorry I thought I saw something by your foot. 
~~~

As G'rung lands, Vines burst up out of the ground beside the G'rung. A body that was stuck to this monster falls to the ground beside  
~~~
G'rung: Me found it. 
~~~

The party launches an attack on the creature. When Oriaanna fires a firebolt she notices that it does not much damage to it. Tezzaran noticing that fire had little effect attempts to throw an acid vial at it but misses. Orianna switches to fire a Witch Bolt at the creature, but it only seems to heal some of the damage done by Oriaanna. 

The vined creature take a step forward and bludgeoned G'rung with a big hit. Our three tiefling compatriots step forward to attack the creature. G'rung rages and attack. Baka steps forwards and misses a Guiding Bolt but steps into melee distance and heals G'rung. Bastion misses a longsword hit.

Tezzaran jogs forward to a spot where nobody is in front of the creature and misses another throw with an acid vial. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Ah pish. I'll just hit it with magic.
~~~
Oriaanna fires a magic missile at the creature.
