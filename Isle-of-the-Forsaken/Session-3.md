# Isle of the Forsaken - Session 3 - 29/09/21
 

## Day 6 (April 19th) Part 2 - Weather: Sunny with Moderate Wind.

The party sets foot within the gates. Ahead of us is an inn called the Rivers Bounty. They see a young Human woman: Ginger hair, athletic build 5'11ft, grey eyes, brown skin. Running towards the inn, hops the fence and dashes in the front door. From behind the inn another person (olive skin and black hair) hops the fence to a building to the west. 

After a minute, a scream is heard from the tavern and the ginger woman bursts out and is accompanied by a blond haired very skinny woman who hops the fence and runs in a southernly direction. 

~~~
Tezzaran: Do you need help?
~~~

The blonde one continues on ignores this call, but the ginger woman stops, looking confused she she slowly makes her way towards the party. From the house to the west the person that just run in person joined by a pink-skinned blue-haired Karen Aasimar, and they run in the direction of the blonde woman.  

~~~
Ginger Woman: Do you konw what you might be able to help?
Tezzaran: We're here we might as well. 
Orianna: Stop! We can help you, but can you give us more information
Ginger Woman: There's injured people in the church, help!
~~~

The party follows the running woman to the church to the south of the village. 
~~~
Nightingale: *mimmicks police siren*
~~~

At the church the blonde woman is in a heated discussion with a Tiefling man (black skin, white eyes and longer-than-shoulder length black hair) whose lower part of left arm is missing (looks like it's torn off) and bleeding out on the floor. 

~~~
G'rung: Need help with kill?
~~~

At this remark, everyone in the church is looking at the frog. 

~~~
Tezzaran: What my friend means is how can we be of service?
Aasimar woman: My daughters partner is still out there. Something has come over the forest recently and tt caught the hunters unawares. We need someone to go out nad see what happens?
Tezzaran: *breaths out* What is your name, who are we looking for and how many of you returned. 
Jazmal: My name is Jazmal. 2 people are missing Robert (Cersei's father) and (Seers parner) Mormo are missing. 2 are injured. The 2 runners returned unharmed. 
Tezzaran: What's the quickest way to get to where they came from. 

Baka: Take me to the wounded
~~~

Baka goes over to the wounded and helps out, but the loxodons are doing a better job. 

Three more people enter the fray. The leader (black hair red eyes, purle skin. Short horns that curl up a little.) kicks open the church door. They are wearing studded leather armour. The second is a young pink tiefling that stares at the leader in awe, and the third is a white skin sliver eyed tiefling. The start shouting for an update   

They see us and head over. 

~~~
Entropy: Who are you?
Tezzaran: We are passing strangers. Looking to help out in any way we can 
Entropy: Good, more backup
Baka: Now is not the time for many words
G'rung: We need help. Let's go now.
~~~

Jazmal rattles off a list of local landmarks to Entropy who heads off in that direction.
~~~
Tezzran: *jogging after the leader* Excuse me, we'll join you, but what if your name
Entropy: Entropy
Astar: I'm Astar and he's Chairon. 
~~~

On the way to the forest. Entropy explains that they are training to be an adventurer like us. The town has an elder system, made up of the most senior of each of the professions. The forest we are going starts of semi-lush but quickly turns into one where the trees have gnarles leaves and what would be underbush is more spiiked vines and dead plants. It's conspiciously absent of any bird noise. This happened about a month ago after a thunderstorm and this darkness is spreading towards the town. They do not know what the creature looks like. 

Looking around. Tezzaran finds an absence of any creature tracks at all. 

~~~
Tezzaran: How will find this creature.
G'rung: Me know hunt. There will be scream.
Tezzaran: I think I agree with you G'rung. I don't see a single creature track. I think the creature will find us first rather than us finding it.
G'rung: Me told you. 
~~~

Nightingale jumps back as she spots a mummifies hand underneath her foot. The party looks at it and Tezzaran pokes it with a stick. It just seems to be a severed mummified hand. 

~~~
Baka: I don't think this hand belongs to any of the people we are looking for. I think we should move on.
Tezzaran: I agree. *kicks the hand into the bushes.* Lets not let that spook someone else.
Bastion: I think we should journey to the site where 
Entropy: I agree
~~~

Baka and G'rung spot a mangle leg in a tree, and see someone in the tree, staring at the ground and cowering in fear of the nearby forest, but we see nothing. 

~~~
Baka: *shouting to person in tree* Should we not be on the ground. 
Tree dweller: It's here, it's just very still. If I take my eyes off it, I will lose it.
~~~

The party inches closer, preparing to attack. While looking for the creature, Tezzaran is spooked by something and fires a firebolt at the ground in front of G'rung, who leaps forward. 

~~~
Tezzaran: Sorry I thought I saw something by your foot. 
~~~

As G'rung lands, Vines burst up out of the ground beside the G'rung. A body that was stuck to this monster falls to the ground beside  
~~~
G'rung: Me found it. 
~~~

The party launches an attack on the creature. When Oriaanna fires a firebolt she notices that it does not much damage to it. Tezzaran noticing that fire had little effect attempts to throw an acid vial at it but misses. Orianna switches to fire a Witch Bolt at the creature, but it only seems to heal some of the damage done by Oriaanna. 

The vined creature take a step forward and bludgeoned G'rung with a big hit. Our three tiefling compatriots step forward to attack the creature. G'rung rages and smashes the mound with his warhammer. Baka steps forwards and misses a Guiding Bolt but steps into melee distance and heals G'rung. Bastion misses a longsword hit.

Tezzaran jogs forward to a spot where nobody is in front of the creature and misses another throw with an acid vial. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Ah pish. I'll just hit it with magic.
~~~
Oriaanna fires a magic missile at the creature. Our tiefling compatriots take small chunks out of it. Nightingale sneakily stabs the big creature in the back, and it shreaks, flailing it's vines falls back and collapses into the hole. 

~~~
G'rung: Me think it's dead.
~~~
G'rung is pretty sure it's dead, but is so angry at the mossy creature, he hits it anyway. The creature did not move. The party is still weary of the creature and Baka readies their weapon just in case and the rest of the party in turns tries to check if the creature is dead, but it doesn't seem to be alive in the way we know it. The party thinks that perhaps the lightning storm before was responsible for animating this creature and that if the creature was going to move, some form of lightning could do so.

The tieflings underlings are happy it's dead and are heading off to the base of the tree with the person in it. It's Mormo, but when they ask him to get down shakes his head and stares at the creature intently. Nightingale syping the cowering Mormo pours oil over the creature and lights the oil. The oil burns but the vegitiation of the creature doesn't seem to be on fire. Nightingale runs around to try and get more twigs to stoke the fire.  

Bastion and Tezzaran heads over to the tree with Mormo in it. Tezzran 
~~~ 
Tezzaran: Mormo, Are you still in the tree because you think the creature is not dead.
Mormo: It's done this before. It was very still from the time the scouts left until you arrived.
Tezzaran: OK! I think we should keep attacking it. 
~~~
Oriaanna upon hearing this conversation fires a crossbow at the monster and it doesn't react. The tiefling underlings attempt to climb the tree to reach Mormo. Nightingale piles more wood on the fire to keep their fire going, and the moss and twigs on the creature starts turning grey. G'rung attacks again with the warhammer and the vines crumble like dead wood. 
~~~ 
G'rung: It's dead. Me know forest. You can come down now. 
~~~
Baka taps on the creature with their mace for good measure. Tezzaran wants to see how this creature dies for itself and hacks at the branches with his sickle. As he does this a body is revealed, which falls from creature and goes underneath. 
~~~
Tezzaran: Oh there was a body here. Someone help me get it out before it burns!
~~~
G'rung bounces over to Tezzaran and they pull the body out from underneath before the fire hits it. Tezzaran tries to assess the condition of this man. 
~~~
Tezzaran: This one is alive! Baka heal this man! 
Baka: This man is clearly dead. You probably need some 
Tezzaran: *Looking more closely an examining the body in more detail* How could I have missed this? Or this?
Baka: *explains to Tezzaran features of this dead body*
~~~

Nightingale loops one end of a rope and throws it into the trees to try and help Mormo get down. Mormo fails to get into the coil and catches the loop in the wrong way. falls out of the tree, but Astar manages to catch him before he smashes into the tree and Nightingale and G'rung slowly lower him to the ground. 

Tezzaran with something to prove comes over and rigorously examines Mormo. He determines that he wouldn't have survived the night without medical help. He secures the leg in a splint and Oriaanna heals him. 
~~~ 
Tezzaran:
Tezzaran: Can you identify the other body as Robert?
~~~
 Tezzaran.  Entropy identifies the other body as Robert. The Grung and Entropy carry this body. Tezzaran offers to make a makeshift stretcher out of the spears of the tiefling underlings and a bedroll, and Baka kindly offers theirs. With this the tieflings take Mormo and the party heads back into town without further incident, and heads to the church.
